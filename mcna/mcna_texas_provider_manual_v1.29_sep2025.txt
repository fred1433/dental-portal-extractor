I. Introduction

I. INTRODUCTION
Managed Care of North America, Inc., (MCNA) was founded by a group of dentists with
extensive backgrounds in the fields of dental care and dental plan operations. MCNA’s goal is to
provide quality dental services to members and providers. MCNA has an organized network of
private dental offices throughout the State of Texas. MCNA recognizes the vital role the dental
office plays in a successful dental plan. The purpose of this Provider Manual is to provide you
with an explanation of administrative procedures, provisions, and the role you play as a dentist.
We appreciate your participation and look forward to partnering with you to improve the oral
health of your patients and to develop your practice.
MCNA may make additions, deletions, or changes to the policies and procedures described in
this Provider Manual at any time. We will give providers at least 30 days advance notice before
implementation. As a participating provider, your agreement requires you to comply with MCNA
policies and procedures, including those contained in this manual.

For the latest version of this manual in digital form,
please access the MCNA online Provider Portal at:

http://portal.mcna.net/
or visit:

to download a PDF version directly.

Objective of Programs
Our mission is to deliver value to our clients and participating providers by providing access,
quality, and service excellence that improves the oral health outcomes of our members.

II. Criteria for Network Participation

II. CRITERIA FOR NETWORK PARTICIPATION
The Dentist Participation Criteria lists a variety of requirements that all providers participating
with MCNA must meet. These requirements include standards regarding your office’s physical
attributes, practice coverage, member access, office procedures, office records, insurance and
professional qualifications, and work history. These criteria are used in our credentialing and recredentialing process and are attached as a part of our current Provider Agreement.

Applicability
1. The participation criteria shall apply to each applicant for participation and to dentists
participating with MCNA. Criteria shall be enforced by MCNA as required by the Texas
Medicaid and/or the Children’s Health Insurance Program (CHIP) program(s). The
dentist must satisfactorily document evidence meeting the criteria listed for at least six
(6) months prior to application unless the applicant has entered clinical practice or
completed a residency or a fellowship program within the past six (6) months or currently
participates with the Texas Medicaid and/or the Children’s Health Insurance Program
(CHIP) programs.
2. Each participating dentist must continue to meet the credentialing criteria while
participating with MCNA.
3. All MCNA participating dentists in a group practice must meet MCNA credentialing
criteria. If all of the dentists in the group do not meet the criteria, the group cannot
participate.
4. To participate in the Texas Medicaid and/or Children’s Health Insurance Program (CHIP)
program(s), the dentist must be credentialed, must execute a Provider Agreement, and
must agree to provide services to Medicaid and/or CHIP members.
5. All dental providers are re-credentialed every three (3) years.
6. Substitute dentists must also meet MCNA credentialing criteria. A copy of the substitute
dentist agreement must be submitted to MCNA.

Office Survey
Office surveys are conducted on an ongoing basis for participating offices, either in-person or
virtually. Each review highlights essential areas of office management and dental care delivery.
The survey, which may or may not be scheduled in advance), may cover the following areas:
1. General Information – the name and address of the practice, name of principal owner
and associates, license numbers, staffing information, office hours, list of foreign
languages spoken in the office, availability of appointments and method of providing 24-

II. Criteria for Network Participation

hour coverage (e.g., answering services, etc.), and the name of the covering dentist
when the office is closed (e.g., closing for a scheduled vacation)
2. Practice History – information regarding malpractice suits, settlements, and disciplinary
actions, if applicable
3. Office Profile - indication of services routinely performed at office
4. Facility Information – description of office location, accessibility (including handicap
accessibility), interior office (e.g., the reception area, operatories, and lab), types of
infection control, and types of equipment and radiographic equipment
5. Risk Management – includes review of personal protective equipment and methods
(e.g., gloves, masks, handling of waste disposal, sterilization, and disinfection methods),
training programs for staff, radiographic procedures and safety protocols, occupational
hazard control regarding amalgam, nitrous oxide, and hazardous chemicals, and
medical emergency preparedness training and equipment
6. Recall System – includes review of office procedures for assuring patients are scheduled
for recall examinations and follow-up treatment
7. Verification that all MCNA-participating dental providers in a group practice are
credentialed by MCNA

Credentialing/Re-credentialing
Credentialing is the review of qualifications and other relevant information pertaining to a dental
care professional who seeks acceptance into MCNA’s provider network. The Credentialing
Program follows the recommended CMS categories, which include:
•

Initial Credentialing – written application, verification of information from primary and
secondary sources, confirmation of eligibility for payment under Medicare and/or
Medicaid, if applicable, and on-site visits as appropriate

•

Monitoring – includes monitoring of lists of practitioners who have been sanctioned
and/or had grievances filed against them, and of practitioners who opt-out of accepting
federal reimbursement from Medicare/and or Medicaid; conducted on a regular basis
between credentialing and re-credentialing cycles

•

Re-credentialing – re-evaluation of provider’s credentials at least every three (3) years
through a process that updates information obtained in initial credentialing; considers
performance indicators such as those collected through the Quality Improvement (QI)
Program, the utilization management system, the grievance system, enrollee satisfaction
surveys, and other activities of the organization

Confirmation of eligibility for payment under Medicaid is verified against the MCO Master
Provider File for all currently active Medicaid providers as determined and provided by Texas

MCNA_TX-P_PM[1.29]

Page 14

II. Criteria for Network Participation

Medicaid. The Credentialing Program requires all dental providers with a Texas Provider ID
(TPI) number to complete the Dental Credentialing Form. Additionally, MCNA will:
•
•
•

Verify Texas license through appropriate licensing agency
Review federal and state sanction activity including Medicare/Medicaid services (OIGOffice of Inspector General and state Medicaid agencies)
Review monthly reports released by the Office of Inspector General and local Medicaid
agencies to review for any network providers who have been newly sanctioned or
excluded from participation in Medicare/Medicaid

The Credentialing Program establishes the selection criteria for qualification as a participating
provider. The set of criteria is clearly outlined in the credentialing application and is reviewed
and approved by the Credentialing Committee.
Additionally, current copies of the following documents must be submitted to MCNA for initial
credentialing as well as for re-credentialing. These documents are required as components of
the selection criteria and will be verified using primary and secondary sources.
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•

Texas dental license
Medicare/Medicaid (CMS) provider number
Controlled Substance Registration Certificate from the Drug Enforcement Agency (DEA)
Professional liability insurance face sheet
Curriculum Vitae (CV)
Board certificate or evidence of adequate training
Completed W-9 Form
Signed Provider Agreement/Contract
Signed Provider Application
Provider roster

It is the provider’s responsibility to submit any renewal certification documentation or changes in
information to MCNA within ten (10) business days of any change.
Providers have the right to obtain the status of their credentialing application, and to review and
correct any erroneous information obtained and used by MCNA Dental to evaluate their
credentialing application at any time after submission.
Providers must be actively enrolled with Texas Medicaid (TMHP) in order to be reviewed for
MCNA network participation and to receive payment. It is the provider’s responsibility to
maintain and update their provider information with all credentialing entities (TMHP, MCNA,
NPPES, etc.) to avoid issues with MCNA denied or recouped claims.

II. Criteria for Network Participation

Credentialing Committee Appeals
In the event an applicant is denied or credentialed with restrictions, the Credentialing Committee
offers the opportunity to appeal. An appeal must be requested in writing and must be reviewed
by the committee within 30 days of the date the committee gave notice of its decision.
A copy of MCNA’s credentialing policies can be obtained by contacting the Provider Hotline at
1-855-776-6262.

Peer Review Committee
Peer review of professional competency or conduct may result in a proposed adverse action for
“medical disciplinary cause or reason” affecting a provider’s continued participation with MCNA.
A “medical disciplinary cause or reason” refers to an aspect of a provider’s competence or
professional conduct that is reasonably likely to be detrimental to the delivery of patient care.
The Chief Dental Officer may immediately initiate corrective action against a provider for
identified medical disciplinary cause, or any other reason where the Chief Dental Officer
reasonably believes that the failure to take such action may result in imminent danger to the
health of any individual.
MCNA’s Peer Review Committee meets as necessary to objectively and methodically assess,
evaluate, and resolve issues related to the quality and appropriateness of care, safety, and
service. It determines appropriate actions to be taken relating to contracted participating
provider’s professional competency or conduct and quality of care issues. The Peer Review
Committee also monitors the results of the improvement strategy that is implemented and
ensures appropriate re-evaluation. The Peer Review Committee serves as the initial committee
that reviews the quality of care occurrence and renders the initial determination. The peer
review appeal panel(s) serve(s) as the tool to allow providers a dispute process where MCNA
has made the decision to reduce, suspend, or terminate their participation in the MCNA provider
network.
The Peer Review Committee and peer review appeal panel(s) consist(s) of at least three (3)
qualified dentists. Of those three (3) individuals, at least one (1) must be a dentist who is not
otherwise involved in network management and/or who is a clinical peer of the participating
provider in question. In addition, one (1) dentist must practice in the same specialty as the
provider who is being evaluated. None of the qualified dentists can have been involved in the
initial determination and be a panel participant of the previous peer review appeals process.
The provider is notified of the Peer Review Committee’s decision as it is related to quality of
care and competency issues or professional conduct via a certified letter that is sent within 10
business days of the meeting. The letter will advise the provider of the following:
•

The actions and decisions from the committee and the provider or applicant right to
dispute the decision at the first-level peer review appeal panel

MCNA_TX-P_PM[1.29]

Page 16

II. Criteria for Network Participation

•
•

•

The process for the provider or applicant to submit corrective action or request further
action from the Peer Review Committee
The provider or applicant right to submit a letter disputing the Peer Review Committee’s
termination or suspension decision and provide all supporting documentation to assist in
the dispute within 60 calendar days of the termination notice date
The provider or applicant right to request a first-level peer review appeal panel for a
reevaluation of the initial decision

Peer Review for Provider Disputes
The provider dispute process applies only to contracted network providers. Disputes related to
professional competence or conduct and quality of care and/or patient safety issues are
addressed under the dispute process. In the event that aberrations are found in the quality or
appropriateness of care delivered by a credentialed provider and sanctions, up to and including
termination of participation in MCNA’s network, are brought to bear against that individual, the
provider has the right to enter into a two-level appeal process. The provider will remain an active
network provider throughout the appeal process unless MCNA determines there is imminent
harm.
First-Level Provider Appeal: The first-level peer review appeal panel consists of least three (3)
qualified dentists, of those three (3) individuals, at least one (1) must be a dentist who is not
otherwise involved in network management and/or who is a clinical peer of the participating
provider in question, and one (1) dentist must practice in the same specialty as the provider who
is being evaluated. None of the qualified dentists can have been involved in the initial
determination and previous peer review appeals process. The first-level peer review appeal
panel evaluates the initial determination made by the Peer Review Committee. The panel
evaluates the facts of a case brought before it by a provider appealing MCNA’s initial decision
and determines if the care and service in question meets the standard of care. If the dispute
brought before the appeal panel is found in favor of the appealing provider, no further actions
are necessary. If MCNA’s initial decision is upheld, the provider may request a second-level
peer review appeal as appropriate.
Second-Level Provider Appeal: A provider has the right to appeal the decision made by the
first-level peer review appeal panel by submitting a formal request along with all supporting
documents for a second-level appeal hearing. The second-level appeal function is carried out
through MCNA’s peer review appeal hearing panel. The second-level peer review appeal
hearing panel consists of least three (3) qualified dentists who were not involved with the initial
and first-level decisions. The hearing process is available in the case of quality of care concerns
when MCNA’s proposes to suspend or terminate a participating provider from the network. At
the hearing, the appealing provider has the right to:
•

Representation by an attorney or other person of the provider’s choice

II. Criteria for Network Participation

•

•
•
•

Have a record made of the proceedings, copies of which may be obtained by the
provider upon payment of any reasonable charges associated with the preparation
thereof
Call, examine, and cross-examine witnesses
Present evidence determined to be relevant by the panel, regardless of its admissibility
in a court of law
Submit a written statement at the close of the hearing

A provider who has submitted a written second-level peer review appeal request will be notified
of the anticipated hearing date by MCNA within 10 business days of the receipt of the request.
The notification letter, sent via certified mail, will include a full listing of the provider’s rights
during the hearing, the second-level peer review appeal hearing panel participants, and an
explanation that the provider’s failure to be available at the hearing will not delay the decision by
the panel.

Substitute Dentist Process
In accordance with Texas Administrative Code (TAC) rules §354.1121 and §354.1221, related
to Medicaid billing for the services of substitute dentists, dentists who are temporarily absent
from their practice are allowed to submit claims for reimbursement of Medicaid services
rendered to their Medicaid and CHIP clients by a substitute dentist.
The following are conditions for reimbursement of services rendered by a substitute dentist:
1. Dentists who take a leave of absence for no more than 90 days may bill for the services
of a substitute dentist who renders services on an occasional basis when the primary
dentist is unavailable to provide services. Services must be rendered at the practice
location of the dentist who has taken the leave of absence. A locum tenens arrangement
is not allowed for dentists.
2. This arrangement will be limited to no more than 90 consecutive days. Under this
temporary basis, the primary dentist (who is the billing agent dentist) may not submit a
claim for services furnished by a substitute dentist to address long-term vacancies in a
dental practice. The billing agent dentist may submit claims for the services of a
substitute dentist for longer than 90 consecutive days if the dentist has been called or
ordered to active duty as a member of a reserve component of the Armed Forces.
MCNA accepts claims from the billing agent dentist for services provided by the
substitute dentist for the duration of the billing agent dentist's active duty as a member of
a reserve component of the Armed Forces.
3. The billing agent dentist may recover no more than the actual administrative cost of
submitting the claim on behalf of the substitute dentist. This cost is not reimbursable by
MCNA.

4. The billing agent dentist must bill substitute dentist services on a different claim form
from his or her own services. The billing agent dentist services cannot be billed on the
same claim form as substitute dentist services.
5. The substitute dentist must be licensed to practice in the state of Texas, must be
enrolled in Texas Medicaid, must not be on the Texas Medicaid provider exclusion list,
and must credential with MCNA.
6. The dentist who is temporarily absent from the practice must be indicated on the claim
as the billing agent dentist, and his or her name, address, and National Provider
Identifier (NPI) must appear in Blocks 53, 54, and 56 of the 2012 ADA claim form.
7. The substitute dentist’s NPI number must be documented in Block 35 of the 2012 ADA
claim form. Electronic submissions do not require a provider signature.
8. MCNA must receive a copy of the substitute dentist agreement. Those services not
supported by the required documentation, as detailed above, will be subject to
recoupment.

appointments

MCNA encourages all providers to attempt to decrease the number of “no shows” through active
communication. We suggest that your office contacts an MCNA member prior to a scheduled
appointment either by phone or in writing and remind them of the time and place of the
appointment. Follow-up phone calls or written information should be provided encouraging the
member to reschedule any missed appointment.

Sterilization and Infection Control
Patients and staff must be protected from infectious and environmental contaminants.
OSHA requirements:
•
•
•
•

•
•
•
•

All personnel should wash with anti-bacterial soap before all oral procedures.
All personnel should wear latex gloves, facemask, and eye protection.
All instruments should be thoroughly scrubbed and debrided before sterilization.
All instruments and equipment that cannot be sterilized, including operating light chair
switches, hand pieces, cabinet working surfaces, and water/air syringes and their tips,
should be disinfected using approved techniques after each use.
ADA-approved sterilization solutions should be utilized.
All equipment should be monitored using process indicators with each load and spore
testing on a weekly basis.
All environmental waste, including the disposal of waste and solutions, must be handled
in compliance with all applicable federal, state, and local laws and regulations.
All personnel should utilize radiation badges when appropriate.

Equipment for Sedation Services
The standard of care related to sedation also includes possessing the necessary equipment
required by 22 TAC § 110.4 (2011). Specifically, each time Level IV deep sedation/general
anesthesia is administered, a positive-pressure oxygen delivery system that is suited to the
patient must be immediately available in the treatment location in order to treat a patient for
oxygen loss or cardiac arrest. The failure to have such equipment during sedation increases the
risk of patient harm and falls short of meeting the standard of care for providing such services.
For children 12 years of age and younger, 22 TAC § 110.4 (2011) requires that the dentist
should observe the American Academy of Pediatrics/American Academy of Pediatric Dentists
(AAPD) Guidelines for Monitoring and Management of Pediatric Patients During and After
Sedation for Diagnostic and Therapeutic Procedures. Documentation standards must comply
with Texas Administrative Code.
We recommend that your office strictly follows the manufacturer’s recommended testing and
maintenance schedule for your sedation equipment and maintains records documenting the
testing and maintenance performed. Please contact the equipment manufacturer for full details
about testing and maintenance procedures and schedules.

Medical Emergencies
All office staff members shall be prepared to deal with any medical emergency through the
implementation of the following guidelines:

•

The dentist and at least one (1) other staff member must be trained in current CPR
techniques.
All dental offices must have a formal medical emergency plan and each staff member
must understand his or her individual responsibilities. All emergency numbers must be
posted.
Patients with medical risk shall be identified in advance.
All dental offices must have a portable source of oxygen with a positive demand valve,
blood pressure cuff, and stethoscope.

III. Provider Roles and Responsibilities

III. PROVIDER ROLES AND RESPONSIBILITIES
Main Dental Home Roles and Responsibilities
Texas defines a Main Dental Home as the dental Provider who supports an ongoing relationship
with the client that includes all aspects of oral health care delivered in a comprehensive,
continuously accessible, coordinated, and family-centered way. Establishment of a client’s Main
Dental Home begins no later than six (6) months of age and includes referrals to dental
specialists when appropriate. Within the Main Dental Home, dental care experts work together
as a team with a member’s family to ensure that the child receives the services he or she
needs.
A member’s Main Dental Home is an individual dental provider. Facilities or group practices
cannot be assigned as a member’s Main Dental Home. Federally Qualified Health Centers
(FQHC) and Rural Health Clinics (RHC) are the only facilities that can be assigned and function
as a member’s Main Dental Home.
MCNA must develop a network of Main Dental Home Providers, consisting of Federally
Qualified Health Centers and individuals who are general dentists and pediatric dentists who will
provide preventive care and refer members to specialty care as needed.
In accordance with standards of practice and policy guidelines set forth by the American
Academy of Pediatric Dentistry, Main Dental Home Providers must perform a caries risk
assessment as part of the comprehensive oral examination. Main Dental Home Providers must
bill one of the following caries risk assessment codes: D0601, D0602, or D0603 with every
comprehensive oral examination (D0150), oral examination for a patient under three (3) years of
age (D0145), and periodic dental evaluation (D0120). These risk assessment codes will be
included as part of an informational component of the D0150, D0145, or D0120 billing code and
do not have a separate rate attached to them. The TMHP will reject any D0150, D0145, or
D0120 claim submitted without a caries risk assessment code. Providers will be given the
standard 120-day appeal period for the denied claim to submit proof of performing a caries risk
assessment.
Providers must clearly document the individual patient’s dental condition(s) that justifies the risk
assessment classification submitted with the claim. Documentation must be maintained in the
client’s dental record. The results may be provided using a recognized caries risk assessment
tool or through a narrative addressing caries risk factors. The client’s dental record is subject to
review.
Caries risk assessment information and the provider training information is available on the
Department of State Health Services website. Please access this training and/or other
resources from either this link:

Provider Manual: Texas Medicaid and CHIP
III. Provider Roles and Responsibilities

Texas Medicaid and CHIP participating dentists have the responsibility to develop a
dentist/patient relationship based on trust and cooperation. Coordination of care strengthens the
positive relationship between the member and provider and is a critical tool for achieving
positive oral health outcomes.
Main Dental Home Providers must assess the dental needs of members for referral to specialty
care providers and provide referrals as needed. Main Dental Home Providers must coordinate a
member’s care with specialty care providers after a referral takes place. General dentists and
pediatric specialists must register referrals with MCNA when referring members to another innetwork general dentist or pediatric specialist who is not the member’s Main Dental Home. If a
referral is not submitted to MCNA, the treating dentist’s claims for services will be
denied. The treating dentist must include the referral number in Box 2 of the ADA Claim
Form, or in the “Prior authorization Number” field of the claim in MCNA’s online Provider
Portal. Failure to include the referral number may result in denial of the claim.

First Dental Home Roles and Responsibilities
The Texas First Dental Home promotes the establishment of a dental home for all children
enrolled in Medicaid. The First Dental Home will provide opportunities for early intervention and
prevention of dental disease in children starting at six (6) months of age.
Participating general dentists and pediatric dentists are strongly encouraged to complete
certification as a Texas “First Dental Home Provider.” This course is available on the Texas
Health Steps Free Online Provider Education website. Please go to the Texas Health Steps
website at http://www.txhealthsteps.com and click on the icon labeled “dentist.” At the top of the
page, click on the link “View an alphabetical list of course titles” and scroll down the list until you
find First Dental Home. You will be able to access the most current version of this required
course. Once you have completed the First Dental Home training, you must download the
Continuing Education (CE) certificate and complete a First Dental Home Certification
Application, Form 1091 (fillable PDF). The completed application form and CE certificate should
be emailed to THStepsOEFV.FDH@hhsc.state.tx.us. Alternatively, the completed form and CE
certificate can be faxed to (512) 483-3979.
In addition to establishing a Network of Main Dental Home Providers, MCNA must implement a
“First Dental Home” for Medicaid Members. This will enhance dental providers’ ability to assist
Members and their primary caregivers in obtaining optimum oral health care through First
Dental Home visits. The First Dental Home visit can be initiated as early as six (6) months of
age and must include, but is not limited to, the following:
•
•
•
•
•

Comprehensive oral examination
Oral hygiene instruction with primary caregiver
Dental prophylaxis, if appropriate
Topical fluoride varnish application when teeth are present
Caries risk assessment

III. Provider Roles and Responsibilities

Dental anticipatory guidance as defined in the Texas Medicaid Provider Procedures Manual
(TMPPM), Volume 2, Children's Services Handbook and requires documentation of the specific
information conveyed to the parent/guardian for at least three (3) of the eight (8) anticipatory
guidance topics found in the handbook. Medicaid members from six (6) through 35 months of
age may be seen for dental checkups by a certified First Dental Home Provider as frequently as
every 61 days if medically necessary.

Frew Compliance
A class action lawsuit, commonly known now as Frew, was filed against the state of Texas in
1993 alleging that Texas did not adequately provide Medicaid Early and Periodic Screening
Diagnostic and Treatment (EPSDT) services. These services are known in Texas as "Texas
Health Steps.”
MCNA complies with all contractual requirements regarding Frew compliance and makes every
effort to ensure our members have access to quality dental care.

Preventive Treatment
Patients should be encouraged to return for a recall visit as frequently as indicated by their
individual oral status and within plan time parameters. It is important that each dental office has
a recall procedure in place. The following should be accomplished during each recall visit:
1. Update medical history
2. Review of oral hygiene practices and necessary instruction provided
3. Complete prophylaxis and periodontal maintenance procedures
4. Topical application of fluoride if indicated
5. Sealant application if indicated
Please refer to the American Academy of Pediatric Dentistry’s recommendations for treatment
of pediatric patients by age on the next page for further guidance.

Periodicity and Anticipatory Guidance Recommendations

Specialist Role and Responsibility
The role of the specialist (Endodontist, Orthodontist, Oral Surgeon, Periodontist, Prosthodontist)
is to provide covered services to MCNA members for medically necessary treatment. Once
treatment is complete, the specialist is to discharge the member back to their Main Dental Home
for follow up.

III. Provider Roles and Responsibilities

Members with Co-Occurring Behavioral and Physical Health
Conditions
All behavioral and physical health providers (including PCPs, OB/GYNs, internists, and other
relevant provider types) must share amongst each other clinical information regarding Members
with co-occurring behavioral and physical health conditions, to the extent allowed by federal law.

Access Requirements
Availability and Accessibility
Providers must provide the same availability to MCNA members as is done for all other patients
as stated on page 4, sections 3.6 and 3.9 of the Dental Provider Agreement.
Appropriate access to care is an essential part of MCNA’s Quality Improvement Program.
Access to care is monitored by the Provider Relations Department. Periodically, a written inquiry
or phone call may be generated by a Provider Services Representative to obtain information
concerning the next available appointment.

After Hours Standards
When a provider’s office is closed, the office should have an answering service or answering
machine that:
•
•
•
•
•

Provides instructions for contacting someone who can render clinical decisions or
someone who can reach a dentist for clinical decisions
Provides instructions for obtaining emergency services (advises the caller to dial 911)
Lists the office hours
Instructs the caller to leave a message for someone to return their call
Offers all of the above in any additional language(s) necessary based on cultural
population

Nondiscrimination for Vaccine Status
Providers are prohibited from refusing to provide health care services to any Medicaid client
solely on the client’s refusal or failure to obtain a vaccine or immunization for a particular
infectious or communicable disease unless excepted by Texas Government Code § 531.02119.

Missed Appointments
For assistance with members who have missed an appointment, we invite providers to please
submit an ADA claim utilizing procedure code D9986 – missed appointment or use the Member
Outreach Form located in the forms section of this manual. MCNA will use this data to conduct
member outreach, and provide education on the importance of keeping appointments, canceling
with notice (when necessary) and offer support to the member in appointment assistance.

This includes urgent specialty care - urgent care is defined as the need for
immediate medical service for the treatment of acute or chronic illness and injury

o

Patient must be seen immediately or within 24 hours of request

Therapeutic and diagnostic care
o

Therapeutic and diagnostic care is defined as diagnosis and treatment of an
injury or disease

The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) and
Protected Health Information (PHI)
As a healthcare provider, your office is a covered entity as defined under HIPAA. Your office is
required to comply with all aspects of the HIPAA regulations and rules that are in effect or that
will go into effect as indicated in the final publications of the various HIPAA rules.
MCNA is a covered entity and has taken all required steps to become compliant with all aspects
of the HIPAA rules and regulations. The HIPAA Privacy Rule protects all "individually identifiable
health information" held or transmitted by a covered entity or its business associate, in any form
or media, whether electronic, paper, or oral. The Privacy Rule calls this information "protected
health information (PHI),” and the requirements apply to electronic medical records as well as
paper medical records.
“Individually identifiable health information” is information, including demographic data that
relates to:
•
•
•

The individual’s past, present or future physical or mental health or condition
The provision of health care to the individual
The past, present, or future payment for the provision of health care to the individual

This information identifies the individual or creates the reasonable belief that it can be used to
identify the individual. Individually identifiable health information includes many common
identifiers (e.g., name, address, birth date, Social Security Number).
A central aspect of the Privacy Rule is the principle of “minimum necessary” use and disclosure.
A covered entity must make reasonable efforts to use, disclose, and request only the minimum
amount of PHI needed to accomplish the intended purpose of the use, disclosure, or request. A
covered entity must develop and implement policies and procedures to reasonably limit uses
and disclosures to the minimum necessary. When the minimum necessary standard applies to a
use or disclosure, a covered entity may not use, disclose, or request the entire medical record
for a particular purpose, unless it can specifically justify the whole record as the amount
reasonably needed for the purpose.
The minimum necessary requirement is not imposed in any of the following circumstances: (a)
disclosure to or a request by a healthcare provider for treatment; (b) disclosure to an individual
who is the subject of the information, or the individual’s personal representative; (c) use or
disclosure made pursuant to an authorization; (d) disclosure to HHS for complaint investigation,
compliance review, or enforcement; (e) use or disclosure that is required by law; or (f) use or
disclosure required for compliance with the HIPAA Transactions Rule or other HIPAA
Administrative Simplification Rules.

Marketing Rules
MCNA Dental’s contract with HHSC defines how MCNA (the Managed Care Organization or
MCO) and its contracted providers may market and advertise the Plan.

III. Provider Roles and Responsibilities

Termination of Dental Contract
MCNA Dental may terminate a provider from the network for any misrepresentation(s) made on
his or her credentialing application. Causes for termination with a 90-day notice include, but are
not limited to:
•
•

Failure to meet participating criteria
Failure to provide requested dental records

Causes for immediate termination include, but are not limited to:
•
•
•
•
•
•

Expulsion from, discipline by, or barred from participation in any state’s Medicaid
Program or the Medicare Program
Loss or suspension of professional liability coverage
Failure to satisfy any or all of the credentialing requirements of MCNA
Failure to cooperate with or abide by MCNA’s Quality Improvement Program
Commitment of one or more acts of fraud in connection with the provision of dental
services
Engaging in conduct injurious to MCNA’s business reputation

Providers who wish to terminate their participation with MCNA must provide MCNA with a 90day notice of termination in writing, which includes the final termination date. The notice must be
sent in writing.
If the system identifies a provider with a termination date pending, it will auto-assign a
member to a new Main Dentist (general dentist or pediatric specialist). If a participating
provider is available within the same group practice and at the same Main Dental Home (facility
location), the member will be auto assigned to that provider. If that is not possible, the member
will be auto assigned to a participating provider closest to the member’s geographic location.

V. Referrals

V. REFERRALS
Main Dental Home Providers must assess the dental needs of Members for referrals to specialty
care providers and provide referrals as needed. Main Dental Home Providers must coordinate a
member’s care with specialty care providers after referral.
Routine preventive care referrals must be provided within 30 days of request. All referrals are
valid for a period of one year.

Referral to General Dentist or Pediatric Specialist
As part of the Main Dental Home Program, general dentists and pediatric specialists must
register referrals with MCNA when referring members to another in-network general dentist or
pediatric specialist that is not the member’s Main Dental Home. If a referral is not submitted
to MCNA by the member’s Main Dental Home Provider, the treating dentist’s claims for
services will be denied.
Referrals should be requested through MCNA’s Provider Portal at http://portal.mcna.net. All
referral determinations can be viewed on the Portal. A referral may be utilized by any in-network
general dentist or pediatric specialist at the facility listed on the referral.
When submitting a claim for services that result from a referral:
•

•

The treating dentist must include the referral approval number on the claim
o

In the “Prior authorization Number” field of the claim when submitting through
MCNA’s Provider Portal

o

In Box 2 of the ADA Claim Form when submitting through the mail

Failure to include the referral approval number may result in denial of the claim

Emergency services do not require a referral. Please indicate emergency services provided
via a detailed narrative and/or documentation of medical necessity on your claim submission. All
submissions will be evaluated for medical necessity and compliance with plan rules.

Referral to Specialists
Members have direct access to in-network dental specialists. A referral is not necessary for
members to access in-network dental specialists, but referrals are encouraged as part of
MCNA’s Main Dental Home Program. All referrals will be processed within 72 hours.
Referrals should be requested through the MCNA’s Provider Portal at http://portal.mcna.net. All
referral determinations can be viewed on the Portal.
Emergency services do not require a referral. Please indicate emergency services provided
via a detailed narrative and/or documentation of medical necessity on your claim submission. All

V. Referrals

Second Opinion – MCNA Generated Referral
You should discuss all aspects of a member’s treatment plan prior to beginning treatment and
ensure all of the member’s concerns and questions have been answered. If the member
indicates he or she would like a second opinion, inform the member that MCNA will have to
authorize the second opinion visit to a provider in the MCNA network. MCNA will also cover the
cost of seeing a non-network provider if an in-network option is not available. Upon request, the
referring provider is responsible for providing copies of the member’s dental record,
radiographs, and any other information to the provider performing the second opinion.

Out-of-Network Referrals
General Dental Care
If there are no contracted Medicaid or CHIP in-network general dentists or pediatric specialists
within surrounding areas available to treat MCNA members, MCNA will process out-of-network
referrals. MCNA will initiate the process with select dentists in the member’s area and advise
them of applicable payment guidelines. All out-of-network treatment must be pre-authorized.

Specialty Care
If a required service is not available within the Medicaid or CHIP provider network, the
member’s Main Dental Home Provider may request an out-of-network referral. However, the
Main Dental Home Provider must obtain prior authorization for the required service from the
MCNA Utilization Management Department. You can reach the Utilization Management
Department by calling MCNA’s Provider Hotline at 1-855-776-6262. They will provide the
necessary guidance to complete the process on a case-by-case basis and ensure that all
necessary prior authorizations and agreements are provided.

VI. Prior Authorization of Care

VI. PRIOR AUTHORIZATION OF CARE
Prior authorization of care should be requested electronically through the MCNA
Provider Portal at http://portal.mcna.net. MCNA will process prior authorization requests
within three (3) business days.
IMPORTANT: MCNA’s approval of a prior authorization request does not guarantee payment.
The service(s) will still be subject to retrospective review to confirm medical necessity.
Additionally, "Prior authorization Not Required" or the lack of a prior authorization requirement is
not equivalent to "medically necessary." It is not to be assumed that payment will be dispensed
for a service that does not require prior authorization.
MCNA’s utilization management criteria uses components of dental standards from the
American Academy of Pediatric Dentistry (www.aapd.org) and the American Dental Association
(www.ada.org). MCNA’s criteria are changed and enhanced as needed. Prior authorization
requests are reviewed against MCNA-approved criteria.
Failure to submit a prior authorization request and supporting documentation will result in nonpayment to the provider. Per the Provider Agreement, the provider must hold MCNA, the
member, and the state harmless if coverage is denied for failure to obtain prior authorization,
whether before or after service is rendered.
As stated above, MCNA strongly recommends that providers submit all prior authorization
requests through the MCNA Provider Portal at http://portal.mcna.net. A prior authorization can
also be submitted through CHANGE HEALTHCARE (MCNA Payor ID: 65030) or mailed to our
office at the following address:
MCNA Dental
P.O. Box 740370
Atlanta, GA 30374-0370
Approved prior authorization requests are valid for one year from the date of approval.
Orthodontic treatment prior authorization requests are valid for one year from the date of
approval. If orthodontic treatment does not begin within the valid one year, the provider must
submit a new prior authorization request for approval.
Once a determination has been made, the prior authorization approval will be available to view
on the Provider Portal. For providers not utilizing the Portal, the UM staff will mail a hard copy of
the prior authorization approval within three (3) business days of the determination for standard
requests and within 72 hours for emergency requests. All approvals for services are assigned a
unique authorization number; this number must be submitted with the claim after services are
rendered. After the provider receives an approval via the Provider Portal or mail, they should
contact the member and schedule the authorized services.
Faxed prior authorization requests will be accepted at 954-628-3331.

VI. Prior Authorization of Care

MCNA will not return x-rays, periodontal charting, or other related documents. Please
submit duplicate sets of these documents when you include them with your prior
authorization request.

Emergency Treatment Authorization
MCNA ensures that members have access to emergency care without prior authorization, and
to services and treatment as provided through the state agreement and defined in federal and
state regulations. MCNA ensures that members have the right to access emergency dental care
services, consistent with the need for such services.
Authorization prior to emergency treatment may not be possible. In those instances, the
provider is required to submit specific documentation with the claim post-treatment. This
documentation is the same as is required in the submission of a prior authorization request for
the service codes utilized. Please indicate in box 35 of the ADA claim form or in the “Office
Remarks” section of the electronic form on the Provider Portal that the service was provided on
an emergency basis and prior authorization is not applicable. Claims submitted without this
documentation will be denied. All submissions will be evaluated for medical necessity and
compliance with plan rules.

Children of Migrant Farmworkers
Children of Migrant Farmworkers due for a Texas Health Steps medical checkup can receive
their periodic checkup on an accelerated basis prior to leaving the area. A checkup performed
under this circumstance is an accelerated service but should be billed as a checkup.
Performing a make-up exam for a late Texas Health Steps medical checkup previously missed
under the periodicity schedule is not considered an exception to periodicity nor an accelerated
service. It is considered a late checkup.
We are seeking the assistance of providers to help us identify Children of Migrant Farmworkers.
The Member Outreach Form includes an area to identify a Child of a Migrant Farmworker and is
located in the Forms section of this manual.
Children of Migrant Farmworkers are entitled to the services offered by Case Management for

VII. Claims Administration

VIII. CLAIMS ADMINSTRATION
Claim Submission
Providers may submit a claim to MCNA in three (3) ways:
•
•
•

Electronically through MCNA’s Provider Portal at http://portal.mcna.net
Electronically through a clearinghouse (MCNA Payor ID: 65030)
On paper via mail using an ADA claim form (2012 or newer)
o The ADA claim form can be obtained from various vendors.

Claims are paid by MCNA. Please see the Covered Services, Fee Schedules, and Guidelines
section of this manual for a list of fees. For any claims questions, please contact the Provider
Hotline at 1-855-776-6262. Network Providers must comply with the requirements of Texas
Government Code § 531.024161, regarding the submission of claims involving supervised
providers.
Providers must file claims within 95 days of date of service (DOS). If your claim is not received
within 95 days from the date of service, it will be denied for late submission.
Note: Faxed claims will not be accepted.
Claims will be denied if the member is not eligible on the date of service.
The following are exceptions to the standard 95-day timely filing requirement for claims. Please
note, claims falling under these exceptions must still be submitted within 365 days from the date
of service (DOS):
•

•

•

If there is third party insurance available, Medicaid and CHIP are the payers of last
resort. Claims for members with additional dental coverage should first be submitted to
any primary payer(s). The 95-day timely filing requirement begins on the date of the
primary payer’s Explanation of Benefits/Remittance Advice (EOB/RA).
If the provider files with the wrong plan within the 95-day timely filing requirement (e.g.,
files with the State Claims Administrator but not with the MCO) and produces
documentation to that effect, MCNA must honor the initial filing date as notification of the
claim and process the claim without denying for timely submission. This must occur
within 95 days from the date of notification by the wrong plan. If the 95-day time frame
cannot be met, the provider may submit an appeal within 120 days of the date of
notification by the wrong plan. The appeal submission must include the claim, all
supporting documentation, and the dated documentation from the wrong plan showing
the reason the provider was unable to meet the 95-day time frame.
If a claim could not be submitted within 95 days of the date of service due to an issue
with the provider’s clearinghouse, the provider must submit the claim and the supporting
documentation from the clearinghouse within 95 days of the date of notification by the
clearinghouse. If the 95-day time frame cannot be met, the provider may submit an

•

appeal within 120 days of the date of notification by the clearinghouse. The appeal
submission must include the claim, all supporting documentation, and the dated
documentation from the clearinghouse showing the reason the provider was unable to
meet the 95-day time frame.
All providers receiving payment from Texas Medicaid programs must be enrolled with
Texas Medicaid (TMHP) for the service location. MCNA’s credentialing program requires
validation of this enrollment.
If a delay in submitting a claim for payment was caused by circumstances beyond the
control of the provider, MCNA may receive and process claims upon review of
substantiating documentation that justifies the late submittal of a claim.

MCNA is required to adjudicate a “clean claim” within 30 days of receipt.
Clean Claim - A claim submitted by a dental provider for dental care or services rendered to a
member, with the data necessary for MCNA to adjudicate and accurately report the claim. A
clean claim must meet all requirements for accurate and complete data as defined in the
appropriate 837D (claims type) encounter data guide.
A “clean claim” must have complete information and not involve coordination of benefits, preexisting condition, investigation, or subrogation.
All claims should be submitted to MCNA Dental on an ADA compliant claim form. The claim
form must include the following information:
1. Member name
2. Member identification number
3. Member and/or guardian signature (or Signature on File)

Electronic Claims Using MCNA’s Online Portal
MCNA’s Provider Portal, http://portal.mcna.net, allows participating providers free claims
submission and tracking of all your MCNA claims.
Please print a copy of the claim and eligibility form for your records.
The MCNA Provider Portal allows for an office to attach scanned x-rays, periodontal charting,
and other documents to a claim. FastAttach may be used for electronic claims requiring the
submission of an x-ray. For those not able to electronically attach x-rays, please send a
completed ADA claim form (2012 or newer) with the x-ray(s) to:
MCNA Dental
P.O. Box 23920
Oakland Park, FL 33307
MCNA will not return x-rays, periodontal charting, or other related documents. Please
submit duplicate sets of these documents when you include them with your claims.

Electronic Claims via Clearinghouse and Billing Intermediaries
MCNA providers may submit electronic claims through clearinghouses, which transmit claims to
CHANGE HEALTHCARE (WEBMD). MCNA’s Payor ID code is 65030. MCNA contracts with
NEA FastAttach for the electronic submission of digital attachments for your claims or prior
authorizations.
MCNA providers who use a billing intermediary for claims preparation submission must notify
MCNA of their billing arrangements in writing. If your billing intermediary changes or no longer
exists, you must notify MCNA in writing. A billing intermediary is not a provider’s salaried
employee. A billing intermediary is an individual, partnership, or corporation contracted with the
provider to bill on their behalf.

Paper Claim Form Submission via Mail
Paper claims must be submitted on an ADA claim form (2012 or newer). This form may be
downloaded and printed from our Provider Portal at http://portal.mcna.net after you log in. Paper
claims may be submitted by mail to:
MCNA Dental
P.O. Box 23920
Oakland Park, FL 33307
It is important to affix sufficient postage when mailing in bulk as MCNA does not accept postage
due mail. Insufficient postage will result in the mail being returned to sender and a delay in
processing your claim. Handwritten claims are not accepted.

All claims will be paid promptly within 30 days of receipt when a properly completed claim is
submitted by paper or electronically.
Clean Claim - A claim submitted by a dental provider for dental care or services rendered to a
member, with the data necessary for MCNA to adjudicate and accurately report the claim. A
clean claim must meet all requirements for accurate and complete data as defined in the
appropriate 837D (claims type) encounter data guide.
A “clean claim” must have complete information and not involve coordination of benefits, preexisting condition, investigation, or subrogation.

MCNA Processing of Deficient Claims
Providers have a total of 95 days from the date of service to submit a claim. Time is continual
and ongoing from the date of service for all claims. If a claim is not received by MCNA within
this 95-day time frame, it will be denied.
If a claim does not include all required information such as x-rays or narrative when applicable,
the claim will be denied as deficient. When this occurs, the Explanation of Benefits (EOB) or
Remittance Advice (RA) will state the reason for the denial (e.g., a procedure has a Reason
Code 48 which states “please submit x-ray(s) and narrative with this request”). The provider
must then send in the required information within 30 calendar days from the date of the deficient
denial determination.
The provider’s submission of additional information and documents to MCNA will be considered
submitted on the date it is electronically transferred or, if mailed, the date received by MCNA.
If MCNA does not receive the information on the 30th day (30 calendar days), the claim will be
finalized. The provider will have 120 days from the adjudication date to appeal or seek
reconsideration of the denial.

Reconsiderations
Reconsideration requests must be filed within 120 days of the determination. Reconsiderations
may be filed when a claim has been denied for one of the following reasons:

coverage. Any requested or supporting information such as x-rays or documentation of medical
necessity should be included with the appeal submission. Please see Page 58 for additional
information about the appeal process.
You may submit your appeal or reconsideration online through MCNA’s Provider Portal.

Coordination of Benefits
It is the provider’s responsibility to find out if members have other dental insurance. When other
insurance exists and MCNA is the secondary insurer, a copy of the primary insurance
Explanation of Benefits (EOB) must be submitted with all claims for services rendered to the
member. These claims may be filed electronically if an electronic copy of the EOB is attached.
MCNA will deem a claim paid in full when the primary insurance payment meets or exceeds
MCNA’s reimbursement rates.

Non-Covered Services
MCNA will not pay providers for non-covered services. According to the MCNA contract with
participating providers, the provider will hold harmless members, the plan, MCNA, and the State
for payment of non-covered dental services.
No additional charges may be assessed to covered MCNA members. Per page 27, section 4.8,
of the Provider Agreement, the provider may bill for non-covered services only with a signed
Private Pay form from the member.

Non-Covered Services Private Payment Agreement Form
Texas Medicaid reimburses only for services that are medically necessary or benefits of special
preventive and screening programs such as family planning and THSteps. Hospital admissions
denied by the Texas Medical Review Program (TMRP) also apply under this policy. The
provider may bill a member only if a specific service or item is provided at the member’s
request.

MCNA_TX-P_PM[1.29]

Page 51

Provider Manual: Texas Medicaid and CHIP
VII. Claims Administration

The provider must obtain and keep a written Non-Covered Services Form (see the Forms
section of this manual) signed by the member. The form must be signed by the member and/or
responsible party prior to the services being rendered, and include the following information:
1. A statement that the member is financially responsible for the described services.
2. A complete description of the dental services to be rendered.
3. A statement that the plan, MCNA, and the State will not be responsible for payment of
the described dental services.

Private Pay Orthodontia
Dental providers have the ability to assess and determine whether the member will meet the
orthodontia coverage criteria. Providers are not reimbursed for any diagnostic workups for
treatment plans that are not approved. Dentists should determine whether the member’s
condition meets all the required orthodontia medical necessity and coverage criteria before
performing a diagnostic workup. If the provider knows that the child will not meet the medical
necessity requirements, the provider may inform the member that they have the option to enter
into a Private Pay Agreement. This may occur only if the specific service or item is provided at
the member’s request and an additional “Client Acknowledgement Statement” is signed by the
member and maintained by the provider in the member’s dental record. The “Client
Acknowledgement Statement” must state:
“I understand that, in the opinion of (provider’s name), the services or items that I have
requested to be provided to me on (dates of service) may not be covered under the Texas
Medical Assistance Program as being reasonable and medically necessary for my care. I
understand that the HHSC or its health insuring agent determines the medical necessity of the
services or items that I request and receive. I also understand that I am responsible for payment
of the services or items I request and receive if these services or items are determined not to be
reasonable and medically necessary for my care.”
The provider must obtain and keep a written Non-Covered Services Form (see the Forms
section of this manual) signed by the member. The form must be signed by the member and/or
responsible party prior to the services being rendered, and include the following information:
1. A statement that the member is financially responsible for the described services.
2. A complete description of the dental services to be rendered.
3. A statement that the plan, MCNA, and the State will not be responsible for payment of
the described dental services.

Balance Billing
MCNA contracted providers may not bill members for, or otherwise attempt to recover from
members, the difference between agreed upon contract allowable and the provider’s billed

MCNA_TX-P_PM[1.29]

Page 52

Provider Manual: Texas Medicaid and CHIP
VII. Claims Administration

charge(s). This practice is called balance billing and is not permitted per Article V, sections 2
and 4, of your MCNA Dental Provider Agreement.

Fraud Reporting
Providers are expected to bill only for medically necessary services delivered to members in
accordance with MCNA’s policies and procedures. MCNA and the appropriate governmental
agencies will actively investigate all suspected cases of fraud and abuse. In our commitment to
prevent fraud and abuse, MCNA has implemented a program integrity component of our
Compliance Program. We monitor and maintain integrity by implementing the following
activities:
•
•
•
•
•
•

Duplicate payment prevention
Post-payment utilization review to detect fraud and abuse
Internal controls to ensure payments are not issued to providers that are excluded or
sanctioned under Medicare/Medicaid
Review of alleged illegal, unethical, or unprofessional behavior
Provider profiling to identify over- or underutilization of services
Investigations and audits

All program integrity activities are coordinated with MCNA’s Compliance Department and our
Special Investigation Unit as needed.

Program Integrity
MCNA is committed to controlling fraud, waste, and abuse in the Texas Medicaid and CHIP
dental programs. Our efforts include vigilant and aggressive monitoring, investigation,
enforcement, training, and communication. MCNA monitors the appropriateness and quality of
services provided to our members and verifies services billed by dental providers by performing
pre- and post-payment reviews. These activities help to prevent or recover overpayments paid
to providers. An overpayment includes any amount that is not authorized to be paid by state and
federal programs, whether paid as a result of inaccurate or improper claims submissions,
unacceptable practices, fraud, abuse, or an unintentional error.
When an overpayment is identified, MCNA will begin payment recovery efforts. Providers will be
given the opportunity to submit a refund or payment plan within a specified time period. If a
provider fails to submit a refund within the specified time period, MCNA will pursue all remedies
up to and including termination from participating in our network.
Appealing Program Integrity/Special Investigations Unit Overpayment/Recoupment
Actions
Upon receipt of a notification of overpayment from MCNA’s Program Integrity/Special
Investigations Unit (PI/SIU), the provider or facility has the right to file a written appeal not later
than 45 days from the date you receive the overpayment notice. The written appeal must
include any additional clinical records, x-ray imaging, or other missing documentation that
MCNA_TX-P_PM[1.29]

Page 53

Provider Manual: Texas Medicaid and CHIP
VII. Claims Administration

supports the medical necessity for and provision of the services identified as an overpayment.
The appeal should be submitted as noted in the overpayment/recoupment notification letter.
Peer-to-peer requests are not available in association with PI/SIU audits.
MCNA will consider your written appeal and your documentation evidence carefully. You will be
contacted after that consideration is completed and a decision about your case is made.
If you have any questions, please call us at 1-855-PRO-MCNA. Our office hours are 8:00 a.m.
to 5:00 p.m. CST, Monday - Friday.

Payment Suspensions
If credible evidence of fraud, willful misrepresentation, or abuse under the requirements set forth
by the Texas Medicaid and CHIP dental programs is identified by state and/or federal officials,
MCNA will be directed to impose claims payment suspensions on a provider and/or facility.
Allegations are considered to be credible when they have indicia of reliability and the requesting
state and/or federal agency has reviewed all allegations, facts, and evidence carefully and acts
judiciously on a case-by-case basis. The suspension of payment action is directed by the
requesting state and/or federal agency will be temporary and will not continue if the requesting
agency determines that there is insufficient evidence of fraud, willful misrepresentation, or
abuse by the provider.

Payment Suspension Appeal Rights
Any provider or person against whom a payment hold is applied has the right to appeal this
action by requesting an informal review. A request for an informal review must be directed to the
initiating state or federal agency and received in writing not later than 10 days after the date you
receive the notice of the payment hold.

Laws that Govern Fraud and Abuse
The Federal False Claims Act and the Federal Administrative Remedies for False Claims and
Statements Act are specifically incorporated into § 6032 of the Deficit Reduction Act. These
Acts outline the civil penalties and damages against anyone who knowingly submits, causes the
submission, or presents a false claim to any U.S. employee or agency for payment or approval.
U. S. agency in this regard means any reimbursement made under Medicare or Medicaid and
includes this Program. The False Claims Acts prohibits anyone from knowingly making or using
a false record or statement to obtain approval of a claim.
Knowingly is defined in the statute as meaning not only actual awareness that the claim is false
or fraudulent, but situations in which the person acts with his eyes shut, in deliberate ignorance
of the truth or falsity of the claim, or in reckless disregard of the truth or falsity.
The following are some examples of billing and coding issues that can constitute false claims
and high-risk areas under this Act.
•

Appeals - Claims
A claims appeal is a request for review of an action by MCNA related to covered services
received by the member but for which the provider has not been paid because of a utilization
management, medical necessity or benefit denial. Claims appeals must be received within 120
calendar days from the date of the MCNA’s initial claim determination.
The appeal must be filed in writing and must be accompanied by all supporting documentation.
Within five (5) business days of receipt of the written appeal, MCNA will send to the provider a
letter acknowledging receipt of the appeal. A dental professional with the appropriate clinical
expertise who was not involved in the initial denial will review the post-service provider appeal.
The provider may also request that the reviewing dentist be of like or similar specialty. The
provider will be notified in writing of the appeal decision within 30 calendar days from MCNA’s
receipt of the appeal. If a Medicaid medical necessity appeal remains unresolved (upheld), a
provider is entitled to a Second Level Appeal. A non-network provider of the same or similar
specialty will review the upheld decision and make a determination as to medical necessity. The
determination of the non-network provider will be binding. Second Level Appeal requests should
clearly be labeled as Second Level Appeals and are considered only for Medicaid eligible
members.
Appeals may be submitted online through MCNA’s Provider Portal or in writing as
outlined below.

X. Utilization Management

X. UTILIZATION MANAGEMENT
Utilization Management (UM) is the process of evaluating the necessity and efficiency of health
care services and affecting patient care decisions through assessments of the appropriateness
of care. The UM Department helps to assure prompt delivery of medically appropriate dental
care services to MCNA members and subsequently monitors the quality of that care.
All participating providers are required to obtain prior authorization from MCNA’s UM
Department. The UM Department is available Monday through Friday, 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. CST
(except designated holidays and weekends). All requests for authorization of services may be
received during these hours of operation by calling the Provider Hotline at 1-855-776-6262.
MCNA provides the opportunity for a provider to discuss a decision with the Dental Director, to
ask questions about a UM issue, or to seek information from a dental reviewer about the UM
process and the authorization of care by calling 1-855-776-6262. After business hours or on
holidays, a provider may leave a message, and a representative will return the call the next
business day.
MCNA will not enter into any contractual arrangement that rewards participating providers or
any other individuals who may conduct utilization review activities for issuing denial of coverage
of service or any other financial incentives for utilization decision making. Quality of care will not
be affected by financial and reimbursement-related processes and decisions.
MCNA complies with the following requirements:
•

•

•

Compensation for utilization management activities, ARE NOT structured to provide
inappropriate incentives for denials, limitations, or discontinuation of authorization of
services.
Compensation programs for MCNA Dental Plans, consultants, dental directors, or staff
who make clinical determinations DO NOT include any incentives for denial of medically
necessary services.
Continuous monitoring of the potential effects of any incentive plan on access and/or
quality of care is carried out.

Decision Making Criteria
MCNA’s Utilization Management Criteria uses components of dental standards from the
American Academy of Pediatric Dentistry (www.aapd.org) and the American Dental Association
(www.ada.org). MCNA’s criteria are changed and enhanced as needed.
The procedure codes used by MCNA are described in the American Dental Association’s
Current Dental Terminology (CDT) Manual. Requests for documentation of these codes are
determined by community accepted dental standards for authorization such as treatment plans,
narratives, radiographs, and periodontal charting.

MCNA_TX-P_PM[1.29]

Page 59

Provider Manual: Texas Medicaid and CHIP
X. Utilization Management

These criteria are approved and annually reviewed by MCNA’s Utilization Management
Committee. They are designed as guidelines for authorization and payment decisions and are
not intended to be absolute.
MCNA appreciates your input regarding the criteria used for decision-making. Please contact
the Provider Relations Department toll free at 1-855-776-6262 to comment or make
suggestions. MCNA also complies with the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS)
national coverage decisions and written decisions of local carriers and intermediaries with
jurisdiction for claims in the geographic area in which services are covered.

Peer-to-Peer Availability
MCNA offers the availability of peer-to-peer consultations with our Dental Director and specialty
clinical reviewers related to denied prior authorizations and/or claims. All clinical determinations
are made by Texas-licensed general dentists, pediatric dentists, and specialty dental providers
such as orthodontists and oral surgeons.
Peer-to-Peer requests are not available in association with Program Integrity/Special
Investigations Unit audits.
To request a peer-to-peer discussion, please call your Provider Relations Representative or the
Provider Hotline at 1-855-776-6262.

Guidelines for Chronic Dental Conditions
The Clinical Practice Guidelines are based on the enrolled membership and dictate the
provision of acute and chronic dental care services to assist dentists and members in making
appropriate dental care decisions to improve quality of care. Clinical Practice Guidelines are
developed based on the following criteria:
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•

Reasonable, sound, scientific medical evidence
Prevalence of dental conditions
Extent of variation present in current clinical practice patterns
Magnitude of quality-of-care issues based on existing patterns of clinical practice
Ability to impact on practice patterns
Consideration of the needs of the members
Strength of evidence to support best clinical practice management strategies
Ability to achieve consensus on optional strategy

Clinical Decisions
A prior authorization request for a service may be denied for failure to meet guidelines, clinical
criteria, protocols, dental policies, or failure to follow administrative procedures outlined in the
Provider Agreement or this Provider Manual. All prior authorization approvals and denials are
available through MCNA’s online Provider Portal.

Medical-Necessity Denials
Utilization management utilizes dental policies, protocols, and industry standard guidelines to
render clinical review decisions. Requests not meeting the guidelines, protocols, or policies are
referred to a Dental Director for clinical review. Determinations to deny or limit services are
made by Texas-licensed dentist under the direction of the Dental Director.
The Dental Director is available to discuss any decision rendered with the attending dental
provider.

XI. Quality Improvement

You can help us identify any issues that may directly or indirectly impact member care by
reporting them on an Incident Report Form located in Forms section of this manual. This can be
submitted to MCNA via fax, email, or alternate means.
The MCNA Dental Director might contact your office regarding your incident report. Please keep
a copy of the completed Incident Report Form in the appropriate member dental record.

Quality Enhancement Programs (Focus Studies)
MCNA monitors and evaluates the quality and appropriateness of care and service delivery (or
the failure to provide care or deliver services) to members and providers through performance
improvement projects (PIPs), dental record audits, performance measures, surveys, and related
activities. As a provider for Medicaid, MCNA will perform no less than two (2) state-approved
performance improvement projects (PIPs) per year. The PIPs will focus on clinical and nonclinical areas.

Quality Review of Key Clinical and Service Indicators
One of MCNA’s Quality Improvement Program objectives is to perform a quality review of key
clinical and service indicators to assess and improve member and provider satisfaction by
analyzing data. These clinical and service indicators include reviews of:
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•

Member and provider complaints for care or service
Sentinel events defined as any event involving member care that warrants further
investigation for quality-of-care concerns
National Committee for Quality Assurance’s (NCQA’s) Healthcare Effectiveness Data
and Information Set (HEDIS®)
Application of clinical guidelines
Application of dental record documentation, and continuity and coordination of care
standards
Health outcome intervention studies or activities
Member claims and encounters
Member prior authorization and referral requests
Other utilization management reporting requirements.

The dental records of MCNA’s members must be made available to MCNA for support of any of
the above activities upon request from our representatives.

XI. Quality Improvement

Corrective Action
When specific cases of substandard quality of care are identified during the quality-of-care
review process, a letter requesting corrective action will be mailed to the treating provider. There
are many forms of corrective action that may be recommended. Some examples of corrective
action that MCNA may take include:
•

•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•

Sending a quality correction letter indicating the deficiency or deficiencies and requiring
changes to be implemented within a maximum time frame of 60 days (the seriousness of
the deficiency or deficiencies noted will dictate the number of days that the provider has
to implement the required changes)
Completing special prior authorization/claims review
Completing post-treatment reviews of members by an Associate Dental Director
Requiring a provider to attend training sessions or participate in continuing education
programs
Restricting acceptance of new members until a provider has become compliant with all
standards of care for a given amount of time
Recouping sums paid where billing discrepancies are found during reviews
Restricting a provider’s authorized scope of services
Referring a case to the state Board of Dental Examiners and/or the Department of
Justice, Attorney General’s Office, and/or Office of Inspector General of the State
Terminating the Provider Agreement

Where corrective action is recommended, the priority is to work with the provider to improve
performance and compliance with all MCNA policies and procedures defined in the Provider
Agreement and this manual. MCNA is willing to provide support to a dentist who shows sincere
intent to correct deficiencies.

Member Satisfaction Surveys
The Member Satisfaction Survey is a tool that assists MCNA in rating member experiences with
network providers and MCNA. The survey addresses key member issues such as level of
satisfaction with MCNA, access to care, referral for specialty services, utilization, care received,
and interaction with dental office staff. The survey may be conducted on a random basis, based
on a visit to a specific office, or administered in a variety of combinations. MCNA also complies
with any state requirements regarding annual member satisfaction surveys for its population.
This information is used to implement strategies to improve care and service to our members.
Providers may be contacted to assist MCNA in developing improvement strategies.

MCNA_TX-P_PM[1.29]

Provider Manual: Texas Medicaid and CHIP
XI. Quality Improvement

Provider Satisfaction Surveys
MCNA will take steps to assess the satisfaction of its contracted primary care provider’s
satisfaction with our services. This activity shall include, but not be limited to, analyses of
provider satisfaction of the following:
•
•
•
•
•

MCNA’s response time to provider inquiries and complaints
MCNA communications
Claims payment process
Authorization and referral process
MCNA availability and effectiveness

MCNA will use the results of our Provider Satisfaction Survey and any state-approved
contracted independent surveys to develop and implement plan-wide activities designed to
improve provider satisfaction.
MCNA will make aggregate survey results available to providers and members upon request.

Patient Records - Chart Reviews
As specified in MCNA’s Provider Agreement, MCNA is authorized to conduct reviews of plan
member treatment records. These records are chosen randomly for periodic review. The chart
review includes assessment of the following elements:
•
•
•
•
•
•

Documentation of member’s medical history, dental history, and existing dental
conditions
Radiograph evaluation and diagnostic material used
Treatment plan and timeliness of treatment plan
Actual care delivered in relation to proposed treatment plan
Recall protocol and utilization analysis of actual care delivered
A signed Patient Consent form

This chart review offers MCNA insight into a dentist’s practice patterns. Such review includes
suggested areas of improvement as well as identification of deficiencies. The on-site review is a
component of our Quality Improvement (QI) Program. The data is collected and entered into a
QI database. The data from chart reviews allows for the development of generalized network
and practice patterns along with utilization data. This contributes to MCNA’s ability to support
network providers and their offices with valuable feedback and information. This information is
also used as part of the re-credentialing process.

XII. Member Services

XII. MEMBER SERVICES
Discrimination
Providers must not differentiate or discriminate in the treatment of any member because of the
member’s race, color, national origin, ancestry, religion, health status, sex, marital status, age,
political beliefs, or source of payment.

Confidentiality Policy
MCNA follows HIPAA requirements. We require all contracted providers to also adhere to
HIPAA requirements. Provider agreements require that all providers maintain patient information
in a current, detailed, organized, and comprehensive manner that is in accordance with the
customary dental practices, applicable state and federal laws, and accreditation standards.
Providers must have policies and procedures in place to implement these confidentiality
requirements. In addition to complying with customary dental practices, applicable state and
federal law, and accreditation standards, these policies and procedures should include, but are
not limited to, protection of patient confidentiality under the following circumstances:
•

The release of information using a release form at the request of a member, and in
response to a legal request for information

•

The storage of and restricted access to dental records in secured files

•

The education of employees regarding the confidentiality of dental records and patient
information

Informed Consent Requirements
Providers must understand and comply with applicable legal requirements, as well as adhere to
the policies of the dental community in which they practice, regarding informed consent from
their patients. The provider must give their patients adequate information and be reasonably
sure a patient has understood it before proceeding with planned treatment. Consent documents
should be in writing and signed by the patient and/or responsible party.
The dental provider must obtain and maintain a specific written informed consent form
signed by the patient/member, or responsible party if the member is a minor or has been
adjudicated incompetent, prior to the utilization of a papoose board as part of the
patient/member’s treatment.
Such consent is required for the utilization of a papoose board and is strongly encouraged for all
treatment plans and procedures where a reasonable possibility of complications resulting from
the planned treatment procedure exists. Such consent should disclose risks or hazards that
could influence a reasonable person in making a decision to give or withhold consent.

MCNA_TX-P_PM[1.29]

Page 66

Provider Manual: Texas Medicaid and CHIP
XII. Member Services

Written consent must be given prior to the services being rendered and must not have been
revoked. Members or their responsible parties who can give written informed consent must
receive information about the dental diagnosis, the scope of proposed treatment including
alternatives and risks, anticipated results, and the need for and risks of the administration of
sedation or anesthesia. Additionally, they must receive a full explanation of the treatment plan
and give written informed consent before treatment is initiated. Providers must comply with
TSBDE Rule 22 TAC §108.2, “Fair Dealing.” They may wish to consider seeking advice from an
attorney to ensure the informed consent meets all applicable legal requirements.
MCNA urges all providers to comply with the AAPD’s 2013 “Guideline on Protective Stabilization
for Pediatric Dental Patients.” The guideline can be found online at:
https://www.aapd.org/media/Policies_Guidelines/BP_Protective.pdf

Cultural Competence
MCNA facilitates access to dental services for non-English speaking members. MCNA’s
population is culturally and linguistically diverse. We recognize that this diversity sometimes
serves as a barrier to members and affects their willingness to access all available services.
Title VI of the Civil Rights Act specifically requires that managed care organizations provide
assistance to persons with limited English proficiency, where a significant number of the eligible
population is affected.
MCNA has adopted the recommendations set forth by the National Standards for Culturally and
Linguistically Appropriate Services in Health and Health Care (the National CLAS Standards minorityhealth.hhs.gov) as a guideline to developing the Cultural Competency Program. MCNA
encourages contracted providers to address the care and service to members with diverse
values, beliefs, and backgrounds that vary according to their ethnicity, race, language, and
abilities.
We want to ensure that the communications needs of members with limited English proficiency
are met. MCNA’s Quality Improvement team monitors and evaluates the level of cultural
competency through dental services provided by our network of dentists. MCNA encourages
employees and providers to share and utilize their own cultural diversity to enhance our
program and the services provided to our members.

Availability and Coordination of Linguistic Services
MCNA does not require members to provide their own interpreter when utilizing the services
available to them through MCNA. We will ensure that dental care services are presented in a
culturally and linguistically appropriate manner utilizing a member’s primary language.
•

Interpreter services are available through MCNA at no charge when accessing dental
care when a member contacts the MCNA Member Hotline at 855-691-6262 for
interpreter assistance

Dental ID Cards
MCNA strongly recommends that your office require MCNA members to present their
identification card at each visit so you can confirm eligibility through our online Provider Portal at
http://portal.mcna.net. Members have the ability through the member portal to present their
identification card digitally on their mobile device. Alternatively, you may confirm eligibility by
phone or fax to our office. MCNA also advises that your office keep a copy of the identification
card in each member’s chart.

Automatic Re-enrollment

Plan Changes
As stated in the MCNA Member Handbook:
You can change your child’s dental plan to another by contacting the Medicaid Enrollment
Broker’s toll-free telephone number at 1-800-647-6558. During the first 90 days after you are
enrolled in a dental plan, you can change to another plan for any reason. After 90 days with a
dental plan, you can change to another plan once for any reason. If you show good cause, you
can also change dental plans at any time. An example of good cause is that you can’t get the
care you need through the dental plan.
If you call to change dental plans on or before the 15th of the month, the change will take place
on the first day of the next month. If you call after the 15th of the month, the change will take
place the first day of the second month after that. For example:
If you ask to change plans on or before April 15, the change will take place on May 1.

XV. Member Complaint And Appeal Process

What can I do if MCNA denies or limits my patient’s request for a covered service?
You, with the member’s consent, may ask for an appeal. An appeal may be filed orally or in
writing within 60 calendar days of when the member receives the notice of action from MCNA.
MCNA will acknowledge receipt of the appeal in writing within five (5) calendar days from the
date that we receive it. MCNA or the member can also request a 14 calendar-day extension if
there is a need for additional information and the delay is in the best interests of the member. If
an extension is needed by MCNA, the member will be notified in writing about the reason for the
extension. Members may contact MCNA’s Member Hotline at 1-855-691-6262 get help from an
MCNA Member Advocate with filing an appeal.
The member’s benefits will not end while MCNA reviews the request unless the member is
taken out of Medicaid. If the member is currently receiving authorized services that are now
denied and the member wishes to continue to get these services, the member must file the
appeal on or before the latter of the following:
•
•

Ten (10) business days following MCNA’s mailing of the notice of action
The intended effective date of the proposed action

The request must clearly state that the member wishes to continue getting the services.
Services may be continued until the appeal decision is made. If, however, the appeal decision
aligns with MCNA’s denial, the member may have to pay for the services.
The member has the right to request a State Fair Hearing within 120 days of the date on the
MCNA’s appeal decision notice. MCNA’s appeal process must be exhausted for the member to
request a State Fair Hearing. Members must also exhaust MCNA’s expedited appeals process
before making a request for an expedited State Fair Hearing. A member may request a State
Fair Hearing if MCNA does not resolve the appeal or make a decision on the appeal in a timely
manner. To request a State Fair Hearing please contact the MCNA Member Hotline toll-free at
1-855-691-6262 or write to:
MCNA Dental

Can Someone from MCNA help me file an appeal?
Yes. However, a member’s option to request an External Medical Review and State Fair
Hearing must be no later than 120 Days after MCNA mails the appeal decision notice.

Member Expedited Appeals
If the member’s appeal is about care that is medically necessary and needed soon, a dental
professional with the relevant clinical experience other than the dental reviewer rendering the
original denial decision will review the appeal on an expedited basis. An expedited review
process is available for a member appeal that is for pre-service dental necessity. The request

MCNA_TX-P_PM[1.29]

Page 86

Provider Manual: Texas Medicaid and CHIP
XV. Member Complaint And Appeal Process

for this process may be filed orally or in writing. The expedited review process may take place
when MCNA determines or the provider/practitioner indicates that taking the time for a standard
resolution could seriously jeopardize the member’s life, health, or ability to attain, maintain, or
regain maximum function. Members may contact MCNA’s Member Hotline at 1-855-691-6262
get help from an MCNA Member Advocate with filing an appeal.
MCNA will decide on an expedited review no later than 72 hours after we receive the expedited
review request, subject to an authorized extension of up to 14 calendar days.
If MCNA denies a request for expedited resolution of an appeal, the appeal will be transferred to
the standard appeals process and be resolved in 30 calendar days. MCNA will contact the
member by telephone to inform him or her of the decision to deny the expedited request. We will
follow the phone call within two (2) calendar days with a written notice.
MCNA will notify all Medicaid members of their right to request an expedited State Fair Hearing
and that they may be represented by an authorized representative in the State Fair Hearing
process. Member must exhaust MCNA’s expedited appeals process before making a request
for an expedited State Fair Hearing. If MCNA does not respond to a request for an expedited
appeal within 72 hours, a member may request a State Fair Hearing.

Member Request for State Fair Hearing
Can I ask for a State Fair Hearing?
If you, as a member of the dental plan, disagree with the dental plan’s decision, you have the
right to ask for a State Fair Hearing. You may name someone to represent you by writing a
letter to the dental plan telling them the name of the person you want representing you. A
provider may be your representative. You or your representative must ask for the State Fair
Hearing within 120 days of the date on the dental plan’s appeals decision letter. If you do not
ask for the State Fair Hearing within 120 days, you may lose your right to a State Fair Hearing.
To ask for a State Fair Hearing, you or your representative should either send a letter to the
dental plan:
MCNA Dental
Attention: Grievance and Appeals Department
P.O. Box 740370
Atlanta, GA 30374-0370
Or call: Member Hotline 1-855-691-6262.
If you ask for a State Fair Hearing within 10 business days from the date on the appeals
decision letter, you have the right to keep getting any service the dental plan denied, at least
until the final hearing decision is made. If you do not request a State Fair Hearing within 10

denied will be stopped.

At no time will a member be discriminated against because he or she has filed an appeal. We
always respect our members’ privacy. Anything that they say or write is kept confidential.

What can a CHIP member do if MCNA denies or limits covered
services his/her dentist is requesting?
The member can file an appeal with MCNA. An appeal is the formal process by which MCNA
addresses a decision that dental services furnished, or proposed to be furnished, to a member
are not medically necessary or not appropriate.

Member Appeal Process
An appeal may be filed orally or in writing within 30 calendar days of when the member receives
the notice of action from MCNA. MCNA will acknowledge receipt of the appeal in writing within
five (5) calendar days from the date that we receive it. MCNA will resolve and provide written
resolution of all member complaints no later than 30 days from the date the complaint is

days of receipt of the appeal. If a CHIP member is dissatisfied with MCNA’s resolution of an
appeal, he or she may file a complaint with the Texas Department of Insurance by contacting
them at 1-800-252-3439.

Member Expedited Appeals
If the member’s appeal is about care that is medically necessary and needed soon, a dental
professional with the relevant clinical experience other than the dental reviewer rendering the
original denial decision will review the appeal on an expedited basis. An expedited review
process is available for a member appeal that is for pre-service dental necessity. The request
for this process may be filed orally or in writing. The expedited review process may take place
when MCNA determines or the provider/practitioner indicates that taking the time for a standard
resolution could seriously jeopardize the member’s life, physical or mental health, or ability to
attain, maintain, or regain maximum function.
MCNA will decide on an expedited review no later than one (1) working day from the date all
information necessary to complete the appeal is received, subject to an authorized extension of
up to 14 calendar days. MCNA will notify you and the member of the expedited review decision
by phone, fax, or mail. Members may contact MCNA’s Member Hotline at 1-855-691-6262 to get

Independent Review Organization (IRO)
Independent review is a process, independent of all affected parties, to determine whether a
health care service is medically necessary and medically appropriate. If an MCNA CHIP
member is not satisfied with an appeal decision, they may be eligible for an Independent
Review Organization (IRO) to review the decision and make a determination about the medical
necessity and appropriateness of health care delivered or proposed to be delivered.
As stated in the MCNA member handbook:
If you do not agree with our appeal decision, you or someone you name to act for you have the
right to have an external review of the appeal decision made by MCNA. MAXIMUS Federal
Services is an IRO that will review your appeal and decide if the services we denied or limited
are medical necessary. The IRO has no connection to MCNA or the decisions made by MCNA
to deny or limit services. They will make their decision based on certain rules. We must pay the
cost of the external review conducted by IRO. MCNA must abide by the IRO’s decision and
carry out its instructions. You can call our Member Hotline toll-free at 1-855-691-6262 if you
have any questions about the independent review process.
How can I ask for an External Review? How long does it take?
You can contact MAXIMUS Federal Services to ask for an external review. You or someone you
name to act for you, must make your request within 4 months from the date you get MCNA’s
notice of denial. To make your request online go to www.externalappeal.com and choose
“Request a Review Online.” You can also fax your written request to 1-888-866-6190 or send it
by mail:
Maximus Federal Services
3750 Monroe Avenue, Suite 750
Pitsford, NY 14534
For each external review request, the patient, parent, or the patient’s legal guardian must sign
the consent to release medical information to the IRO. The consent is included as part of the
HHS-Administered Federal External Review Request Form.

When Maximus Federal Services receives our request, they will notify MCNA. We will send
them all the case information for review. You can submit additional written comments to
Maximus Federal Services at the mailing address above. Any additional information you choose
to send will be shared with MCNA. This gives us an opportunity to reconsider our decision to
deny your appeal.
If we do not change our decision, MAXIMUS Federal Services will review your case. They will
provide you with a written determination no later than 45 days after they receive the request for
the external review. If MAXIMUS Federal Services decides to overturn MCNA’s decision, we will
provide coverage or payment for your health care item or service.

Therapeutic Services
Medicaid reimbursement is contingent on compliance with the following limitations:
•

Documentation requirements.

•

All fees for tooth restorations include local anesthesia and pulp protective media, where
indicated, without additional charges. These services are considered part of the
restoration.

•

More than one (1) restoration on a single surface is considered a single restoration.

•

A multiple-surface restoration cannot be submitted as two (2) or more separate
restorations.

•

If two (2) or more restorations are placed on the same tooth, a maximum restoration fee
that can be reimbursed per tooth has been established such that all restored surfaces on
a single tooth shall be considered connected.

•

Restorations and therapeutic care are provided as Medicaid services based on medical
necessity and reimbursed only for therapeutic reasons, not preventive purposes (refer to
CDT).

•

Total restorative fee per primary tooth for single dates of service within a six-month
period cannot exceed $149.12, which is the fee for a stainless steel crown (exceptions:
D2335 and D2933), when provided by the same provider, facility, or group. Exceptions
will be considered when pre-treatment x-rays, images, intra-oral photos, and narrative
documentation clearly support the medical necessity for the retreatment dental service
during pre-payment review.

•

The following procedure codes will be limited to once per rolling year, for the same TID,
by the same provider, facility or group: D2140, D2150, D2160, D2161, D2330, D2331,

similar) restoration (s) on the same tooth ID within a 12-month rolling period, please
submit with the claim documentation demonstrating medical necessity for clinical review.
o

If a restoration is performed within 12 months of another restoration on the same
tooth (TID), please submit documentation demonstrating medical necessity for
clinical review at the time of submission. This should include an explanation of
why the additional restoration was needed in such a short time frame.

Direct pulp caps may be reimbursed separately from any final tooth restoration performed on
the same tooth (as noted by the TID) on the same date of service by the same provider, facility,
or group.
All dental restorations and prosthetic appliances that require lab fabrication may be submitted
for reimbursement using the date on which the final impression was made as the date of
service. If the member did not return for final seating of the restoration or appliance, a narrative
must be included on the claim form and in the member’s chart in lieu of a postoperative

radiograph. The 95-day filing deadline is in effect from the date of the final impression. If the
member returns to the office after the claim has been filed, the provider is obligated to attempt
to seat the restoration or appliance at no cost to the member or Texas Medicaid.
All restoration placement must extend through the enamel and into dentin to ensure a
successful long-term outcome. The restoration must follow established dental protocol in which
the preparation and restoration should include all grooves and fissures on the billed surface(s).
For providers to bill for a complex occlusal-buccal or occlusal-lingual restoration, the preparation
must extend the full length of the buccal or lingual groove or fully restore the buccal or lingual pit
in addition to the occlusal surface. If the restoration is mesial-occlusal or distal occlusal, the
preparation must extend down the mesial or distal surface far enough for the restoration to be in
a cleanable and inspectable area.

Claims are denied if the procedure code is not compatible with TID or SID. Use the alpha
characters to describe tooth surfaces or any combination of surfaces. For SID designation on
anterior teeth, use facial (F) and incisal (I). For SID purposes, use buccal (B) and occlusal (O)
designations for posterior teeth.

Each identified permanent tooth and each identified primary tooth has its own identifiable
supernumerary number. This developed system can be found in the Current Dental Terminology
(CDT) published by the ADA.
The TID for each identified supernumerary tooth will be used for paper and electronic claims
and can only be submitted for payment with the following procedure codes:
•

For primary teeth only: D7111.

•

For both primary and permanent teeth the following codes can be submitted: D7140,
D7210, D7220, D7230, D7240, D7241, D7250, D7285, D7286, and D7510.

Endodontic Services
Therapeutic pulpotomy (procedure code D3220) and apexification and recalcification
procedures (procedure codes D3351, D3352, and D3353) are considered part of the root canal
(procedure codes D3310, D3320, and D3330) or retreatment of a previous root canal
(procedure codes D3346, D3347, and D3348). When therapeutic pulpotomy or apexification and
recalcification procedures are submitted with root canal codes, the reimbursement rate is
adjusted to ensure that the total amount reimbursed does not exceed the total dollar amount
allowed for the root canal procedure.
Reimbursement for a root canal includes all appointments necessary to complete the treatment.
Pulpotomy and radiographs performed pre-, intra-, and postoperatively are included in the root
canal reimbursement.
Root canal therapy that has only been initiated or taken to some degree of completion, but not
carried to completion with a final filling, may not be submitted as a root canal therapy code. It
must be submitted using code D3999 with a narrative description of what procedures were
completed in the root canal therapy.
Documentation supporting medical necessity must be kept in the member’s record and include
the following: the medical necessity as documented through periapical radiographs of tooth
treated showing pre-treatment, during treatment, and post-treatment status; the final size of the
file to which the canal was enlarged; and the type of filling material used. Any reason that the
root canal may appear radiographically unacceptable must be documented in the member’s
record.
If the member is pregnant and does not want radiographs, use alternative treatment (temporary)
until after delivery.

Prosthodontic (Fixed) Services
Prosthodontic procedure codes require prior authorization.
Periapical radiographs are required for each tooth involved in the prior authorization request.
The criteria used by the Dental Director are:
•
•
•
•
•

At least one (1) abutment tooth requires a crown (based on traditional requirements of
medical necessity and dental disease)
Space cannot be filled with a removable partial denture
Purpose is to prevent the drifting of teeth in all dimensions (anterior, posterior, lateral,
and the opposing arch)
Each abutment or each pontic constitutes a unit in a bridge
Porcelain is allowed on all teeth

Fixed Partial Denture Pontics
The following codes require x-rays and documentation of medical necessity to be submitted with the prior
authorization.
The overall condition of the mouth is an important consideration in whether or not a partial denture is authorized.
For partial dentures, abutment teeth must be caries-free or have been completely restored and have sound
periodontal support. For those members requiring extensive restorations, periodontal services, extractions, etc.,
post-treatment radiographs may be requested prior to approval of a partial denture. Clinical/operational notes may
be requested with the claim for coverage consideration.

Orthodontic Services (Managed Care Orthodontia Review Policy and
Procedure)
Purpose
The Dental Contractors established a managed care policy and process to ensure
consistent and equitable determination of orthodontic coverage for children’s Medicaid
dental services. Comprehensive medically necessary orthodontic services are a covered
benefit for Texas Medicaid members who have a severe handicapping malocclusion or special
medical conditions including cleft palate, post-head trauma injury involving the oral cavity,
and/or skeletal anomalies involving the oral cavity.
Orthodontic services are covered for Texas CHIP members for pre- and post-surgical cases
related to cleft palate, post-head trauma injury involving the oral cavity, and/or skeletal
anomalies involving the oral cavity.
Definitions
Severe handicapping malocclusion is defined as an occlusion that is severely functionally
compromised and is described in detail in Levels I, II, III, and IV.
Orthodontic terminology and the extent of orthodontic services are based on the American
Dental Association’s Current Dental Terminology (CDT) definitions and explanations of the
orthodontic codes utilized within this policy. The following definitions of dentition established by
the CDT manual are recognized by the children’s Medicaid dental services:
Primary Dentition: Deciduous teeth developed and erupted first chronologically.
Transitional Dentition: The final phase of the transition from primary to adult teeth in which the
deciduous molars and canines are in the process of shedding and the permanent successors
are emerging.
Adolescent Dentition: The dentition that is present after the normal loss of primary teeth and
prior to cessation of growth that would affect orthodontic treatment.
Adult Dentition: The dentition that is present after the cessation of growth that would affect
orthodontic treatment.

Orthodontic Prior authorization Requirements for New Cases
Each provider should log in to the MCNA Provider Portal to begin the process. Our goal is to
provide you with a tool that will assist you in determining if the member meets the minimum
criteria for orthodontia care. Once you have entered the appropriate data into our system, an
on-screen dialogue box will advise you of your next step. If the system concludes that, based on
the data you entered, there may be a need for orthodontia care, you may print the form from the
system and include it with your prior authorization request for treatment. MCNA strongly
encourages you to use this tool for all new orthodontia cases you submit.
The following documentation must be submitted with the request for prior authorization:
•
•
•
•
•
•

ADA claim form (2012 or newer) with service codes noted
Panoramic x-ray
Cephalometric x-ray with millimeter scale is required
Color photographs in standard eight (8) photo collage template
Treatment plan and a complete treatment narrative, including total treatment time
For CHIP members only – a copy of the medical prior authorization approval letter for
surgery

Diagnostic quality study models (or OrthoCad equivalent) are not required but will help
to provide information of qualification of the patient. Please note: instead of submitting
physical study models with a prior authorization request, providers are encouraged to
submit diagnostic quality digital images of the study models. Five images w/millimeter
scale are preferred: 1) frontal view (with the study models in centric occlusion) 2) right
lateral view (with the study models in centric occlusion) 3) left lateral view (with the study

the orthodontic clinical reviewer to help in evaluating the request.
Please submit your orthodontia case and all records and documentation in their entirety.
If the records and documentation you submit are incomplete or not of diagnostic quality,
the case will be denied. These records are not separately reimbursed. They are included
in the comprehensive fee structure.
Please do not submit cases involving craniofacial anomalies and/or cleft palates through
the Provider Portal. Instead, please send these types of cases directly to MCNA’s Case
Management Department at tx_case_management@mcna.net.
The member must be a good candidate for orthodontic treatment as assessed by the potential
provider. The member must exhibit a history of good oral hygiene, be under the care of a dentist
for routine care and all necessary dental care (i.e., prophylaxis, restorations, addressing any
noted pathology, including receiving a cleaning within the last six months) must be completed
prior to submission of an orthodontic prior authorization request. This approach is designed to
lessen the occurrence of tooth decay and promote the best possible outcome for the orthodontic
treatment.

Providers may evaluate members who they know would not qualify for covered
orthodontia treatment via “chair-side” evaluation without the need for submission of a
prior authorization request. The member must sign a non-covered treatment form for any
services they agree to pay for on a private pay basis.
Policy
The Dental Contractors recognize four (4) orthodontic service levels for severe handicapping
malocclusion, and each requires a different amount of time for treatment. Each requires different
levels of skill, orthodontic procedures, and time for completion of the treatment plan.
LEVEL I
1.00

LEVEL I: Dedicated to resolution of early signs of handicapping malocclusion in the
early mixed dentition which may significantly impact the health of the developing
dentition, alveolar bone, and symmetrical growth of the skeletal framework. (Presence of
the maxillary and mandibular permanent molars, and the maxillary and mandibular
incisors fully erupted, and deciduous teeth shall constitute the early mixed dentition.)
ONE (1) of the following conditions shall be clearly apparent in the supporting
documentation:
o

Anterior crossbite that is associated with clinically apparent severe gingival
inflammation and/or gingival recession, or severe enamel wear

o

Posterior crossbite with an associated midline deviation and asymmetric
closure pattern

Disclaimer: Dental crossbites, other than the above described, shall not be eligible for
treatment in Level I. However, special orthodontic appliances are a benefit for minor
treatment to control harmful habits.
1.01

Level I orthodontic services must be completed within 12 months unless an
exception is granted.

1.02

Exceptions to the expected treatment time may allow for additional treatment
months for one (1) of the following circumstances:
o

The member is the child of a migrant farmworker

o

The member’s orthodontic services were delayed as a result of temporarily
being in state custodial care (foster care)

1.03

Providers may submit the following procedure codes for Level I review:

Orthodontic Prior authorization Requirements
8.01

Each provider should log in to the MCNA Provider Portal to begin the process.
Our goal is to provide you with a tool that will assist you in determining if the
member meets the minimum criteria for orthodontia care. Once you have entered
the appropriate data into our system, an on-screen dialogue box will advise you
of your next step. If the system concludes that, based on the data you entered,
there may be a need for orthodontia care, you may print the form from the
system and include it with your prior authorization request for treatment. MCNA
strongly encourages you to use this tool for all new cases you submit.

8.02

The following documentation must be submitted with the request for prior
authorization:
a. ADA claim form (2012 or newer) with service codes noted
b. Panoramic x-ray
c. Cephalometric x-ray with millimeter scale is required
d. Color photographs in standard eight-photo collage template
e. Treatment plan and a complete treatment narrative
f.

For CHIP Members Only – a copy of the medical prior authorization
approval letter for surgery

Diagnostic quality study models (or OrthoCad equivalent) are not required but will help to
provide information of qualification of the patient. Please note: instead of submitting physical
study models with a prior authorization request, providers are encouraged to submit diagnostic
quality digital images of the study models. Five images w/millimeter scale are preferred: 1)

10.00 Transfer of Comprehensive Orthodontic Services
10.01 Prior authorization issued to a provider for orthodontic services is not transferable
to another provider. The new provider must request a new prior authorization to
complete the treatment initiated by the original provider.
10.02 The new provider must obtain his or her own records. The following supporting
documentation of medical necessity must be submitted with the request for
transfer of services:
a. All of the documentation that is required for the original request
b. The reason the member left the previous provider

Page 164

Provider Manual: Texas Medicaid and CHIP
XVI. Covered Services, Fee Schedules And Guidelines – Children’s Medicaid Dental Services

he or she is 18 years of age or older or an emancipated minor. A copy of the
signed release form and a completed prior authorization request form must be
submitted, and one of the following must be documented on the prior
authorization request:
a. The member is uncooperative or is non-compliant
b. The member requested the removal of the orthodontic appliance(s)
c. The member has requested the removal due to extenuating circumstances to
include, but not limited to:

MCNA_TX-P_PM[1.29]

Page 165

Provider Manual: Texas Medicaid and CHIP
XVI. Covered Services, Fee Schedules And Guidelines – Children’s Medicaid Dental Services

12.01 An initial payment is payable when bands are placed. Providers must bill with the
appropriate prior authorized procedure code.
12.02 Providers must bill the appropriate monthly adjustment code (D8670). The total
number of monthly adjustments allowed will vary by level.
12.03 The last payment is payable when the treatment is complete. Providers must bill
with the appropriate prior authorized procedure code (D8680).
13.00 General Information
13.01 Providers may prior authorize for additional services that may be deemed
medically necessary due to overall health of the member or extenuating
circumstances. Each case will be reviewed and evaluated on a case-by-case
basis for medical necessity. For example, debanding in regular treatment would
limit retainers and appliance removal to a single episode; however, in the case of
cleft palate, craniofacial, or head trauma with dental consequences, the case
may involve multiple courses of treatment and would gain additional
consideration based on the circumstances.
13.02 Orthodontic services that are performed solely for cosmetic purposes are not a
benefit of Texas Medicaid.
13.03 If a member enrolled in the Dental Contractor’s plan for at least one (1) month is
receiving approved orthodontic treatment and either ages out or loses eligibility,
the Dental Contractor is responsible for completion of payment for the course of
treatment. The only exception is if the member is disenrolled with cause but is
still Medicaid-eligible. If the member completely loses Medicaid eligibility, the
provider must send a letter on office letterhead to accompany the filed claim,
and/or reconsideration request/appeal.
If the provider’s office contacts MCNA’s Provider Hotline about the matter, the
office will be instructed to send the information in writing as an attachment to the
claim, reconsideration request, or appeal. The letter must be on the provider’s
office letterhead and must be signed and dated by the office representative
attesting to the information provided. The letter should include the following
information regarding the member:

that no other dental coverage is in effect

MCNA will utilize this letter to verify that the member has not been changed to
another MCO and has not obtained other dental insurance coverage for the
purpose of consideration of the case and related claims.
13.04 There will be no payment for denied cases, including no payment for records and
the initial exam.
13.05 Payment for banding includes the initial workup.
13.06 MCNA will not return orthodontic models. We require you to make two sets of
models and send us the duplicate set.

Transfer Cases
All transfer cases will be reviewed for medical necessity. Medical necessity will be determined
on a case-by-case basis.
Once MCNA Dental is notified that a member is transferring to another provider, the member’s
DentalTrac™ record will be updated, prohibiting payment of orthodontic services to the current
orthodontic provider.
MCNA Dental will direct the transfer provider to perform an orthodontic evaluation that includes:
•
•
•
•
•

Panoramic x-ray
Cephalometric x-ray
Complete set of color diagnostic photographs in an eight-photo collage template
Texas Medicaid and CHIP Orthodontic Transfer of Care Form and a complete treatment
narrative including total treatment time
Models (if requested by MCNA, or otherwise if the provider deems necessary)

Please submit the case and all records and documentation in their entirety. If the records
and documentation are incomplete or not of diagnostic quality, the case will be denied.
These records are not separately reimbursed. They are included in the comprehensive
fee structure.
An incomplete Texas Medicaid and CHIP Orthodontic Transfer of Care Form or an
incomplete (or not of diagnostic quality) record will result in denial of the case.
The Medicaid and CHIP Orthodontic Transfer of Care Form and treatment notes will be
reviewed by MCNA orthodontic reviewers to identify cases that may require peer-to-peer clinical
discussion on case duration and outcome.
The provider will bill MCNA Dental a claim using CDT Code D8999 and be reimbursed $112.36
for the following components necessary to transfer cases: orthodontic evaluation, transfer form
and treatment notes, panoramic x-ray, cephalometric x-ray, and color eight-photo collage
template.
•

D8999 will be paid once per member

•
•

When billing D8670 in conjunction with D8999, the D8670 will be denied
D8999 will be used to track transfer cases
If a provider changes facilities and the member remains with the provider, D8999 is not
payable as this does not constitute a transfer
Separate, billable procedure codes for panoramic x-ray, and cephalometric x-ray billed
on the same member by the same provider will not be paid

If the transfer provider requests to deband a completed orthodontic treatment, D8680 will be
payable without prior authorization by MCNA Dental. The following requirements apply:
•

If MCNA has not received the approved TMHP prior authorization and/or member claims
history from HHSC, we must receive a copy of the paper TMHP prior authorization or a
TMHP Orthodontic Explanation of Payment (EOP) from the provider to pay D8680

•

If the transfer provider’s course of treatment is to deband a member with the intention of
subsequent rebanding, then that provider must seek approval from MCNA by submitting
a panoramic x-ray, cephalometric x-ray, models or a complete set of diagnostic
photographs, and care progress report

•

If the rebanding is approved by MCNA, then the debanding will not be a separately
payable procedure; it is included in the approved case rate for the rebanding.

Rebanding will only be considered in extreme circumstances. Rebanding to use
provider’s current treatment system is not a valid reason and will not be accepted.

covered dental services in excess of the $564 annual benefit maximum:
1. The preventive services due under the 2009 American Academy of Pediatric Dentistry
periodicity schedule (Volume 32, Issue Number 6 at pp. 93-100).
2. Other medically necessary covered dental services approved by the Dental Contractor through
a prior authorization process. These services must be necessary to allow a CHIP member to
return to normal, pain- and infection-free oral functioning. Typically, this includes:
a. Services related to the relief of significant pain or to eliminate acute infection
b. Services related to treat traumatic clinical conditions
c. Services that allow the CHIP member to attain the basic human functions (e.g., eating,
speech, etc.)
d. Services that prevent a condition from seriously jeopardizing the CHIP member’s
health/functioning or deteriorating in an imminent time frame to a more serious and
costly dental problem
When services are being requested in excess of the $564 annual benefit limit, all requests must be preauthorized. The requests must include x-rays and narratives, even for services that otherwise do not

Therapeutic Services
CHIP reimbursement is contingent on compliance with the following limitations:
•
•

•

Documentation requirements.
All fees for tooth restorations include local anesthesia and pulp protective media, where
indicated, without additional charges. These services are considered part of the
restoration.
More than one (1) restoration on a single surface is considered a single restoration.

•
•

•

•

A multiple-surface restoration cannot be submitted as two (2) or more separate
restorations.
If two (2) or more restorations are placed on the same tooth, a maximum restoration fee
that can be reimbursed per tooth has been established such that all restored surfaces on
a single tooth shall be considered connected.
Restorations and therapeutic care are provided as CHIP services based on medical
necessity and reimbursed only for therapeutic reasons, not preventive purposes (refer to
CDT).
Total restorative fee per primary tooth for single dates of service within a six-month
period cannot exceed $149.12, which is the fee for a stainless steel crown (exceptions:
D2335 and D2933), when provided by the same provider, facility, or group. Exceptions
will be considered when pre-treatment x-rays, images, intra-oral photos, and narrative
documentation clearly support the medical necessity for the retreatment dental service
during pre-payment review. The following procedure codes will be limited to once per
rolling year, for the same TID, by the same provider, facility or group: D2140, D2150,
D2160, D2161, D2330, D2331, D2332, D2335, D2391, D2392, D2393 and D2394.
o If a restoration is performed within 12 months of another restoration on the same
TID, please submit documentation demonstrating medical necessity for clinical
review at the time of claim submission. This should include an explanation of why
the additional restoration was needed in such a short time frame.

All dental restorations and prosthetic appliances that require lab fabrication may be submitted
for reimbursement using the date on which the final impression was made as the date of
service. If the member did not return for final seating of the restoration or appliance, a narrative
must be included on the claim form and in the member’s chart in lieu of a postoperative
radiograph. The 95-day filing deadline is in effect from the date of the final impression. If the
member returns to the office after the claim has been filed, the provider is obligated to attempt
to seat the restoration or appliance at no cost to the member or Texas CHIP.
All restoration placement must extend through the enamel and into dentin to ensure a
successful long-term outcome. The restoration must follow established dental protocol in which
the preparation and restoration should include all grooves and fissures on the billed surface(s).
For providers to bill for a complex occlusal-buccal or occlusal-lingual restoration, the preparation
must extend the full length of the buccal or lingual groove or fully restore the buccal or lingual pit
in addition to the occlusal surface. If the restoration is mesial-occlusal or distal occlusal, the
preparation must extend down the mesial or distal surface far enough for the restoration to be in
a cleanable and inspectable area.
Claims are denied if the procedure code is not compatible with TID or SID. Use the alpha
characters to describe tooth surfaces or any combination of surfaces. For SID designation on
anterior teeth, use facial (F) and incisal (I). For SID purposes, use buccal (B) and occlusal (O)
designations for posterior teeth.

Partial Dentures (Including Routine Post Delivery Care)
Code

Description

Benefit Limits

Fee

The overall condition of the mouth is an important consideration in whether or not a partial denture is authorized.
For partial dentures, abutment teeth must be caries-free or have been completely restored and have sound
periodontal support. For those members requiring extensive restorations, periodontal services, extractions, etc.,
post-treatment radiographs may be requested prior to approval of a partial denture. Clinical/operational notes may
be requested with the claim for coverage consideration.

Teledentistry Services
Teledentistry refers to the use of communication technology by a dentist to provide dental care
services to a patient at a different physical location than the dentist.
Dental evaluation procedure codes D0120 and D0140 may be provided as synchronous
teledentistry services. The service must be delivered using synchronous, real-time audiovisual
technology. The member or parent/guardian must agree to receive the teledentistry service.
Any subsequent dental evaluation visit following a teledentistry visit must be provided in-person.
Providers must follow the rules and regulations of the Texas Dental Practice Act and the Texas
Board of Dental Examiners (TSBDE) in regard to the practice of teledentistry and the
permissible work delegated to a licensed dental hygienist or dental assistant. Services delivered
through the use of teledentistry must meet the same standard of care as those provided in an
in-person setting.

Dental Guidelines
MCNA’s Utilization Management Criteria uses components of dental standards from the
American Academy of Pediatric Dentistry (www.aapd.org) and the American Dental Association
(www.ada.org). MCNA’s criteria are changed and enhanced as needed.
The procedure codes used by MCNA are described in the American Dental Association’s Code
Manual. Requests for documentation of these codes are determined by community accepted
dental standards for authorization such as treatment plans, narratives, radiographs and
periodontal charting.
These criteria are approved and annually reviewed by MCNA’s Dental Management Committee.
They are designed as guidelines for authorization and payment decisions and are not intended
to be absolute.
Providers are welcome to request a copy of MCNA’s clinical criteria through their Provider
Relations representative.

Guidelines for General Dentists and Pediatric Dentists
As part of the Main Dental Home Program, general and pediatric dentists must register referrals
with MCNA when referring members to another in-network general or pediatric dentist that is not
the member’s Main Dental Home. If a referral is not submitted to MCNA, the treating
provider’s claims for services will be denied. The treating provider must include the
referral number in Box 2 of the ADA Claim Form, or in the “Prior authorization Number”
field of the claim in MCNA’s online Provider Portal. Failure to include the referral number
may result in denial of the claim.
Emergency services do not require a referral.
Referrals should be requested through the MCNA online Provider Portal at
http://portal.mcna.net. All referral determinations can be viewed on the Portal. A referral
may be utilized by any in-network general or pediatric dentist at the facility listed on the
referral.

Guidelines for Specialists
The role of the Specialist (Endodontist, Orthodontist, Oral Surgeon, Periodontist, Prosthodontist)
is to provide covered services to members for medically necessary treatment. Members have
direct access to in-network dental specialists. A referral is not necessary for members to access
in-network dental specialists, but referrals are encouraged as part of MCNA’s Main Dental
Home Program. All referrals will be processed within 72 hours.
Once treatment is complete, the specialist is to discharge the member back to their Main Dental
Home for follow-up.
Emergency services do not require a referral.

Referrals should be requested through the MCNA Provider Portal at
http://portal.mcna.net. All referral determinations can be viewed on the Portal.

Guidelines for Oral Surgery
Uncomplicated extractions, removal of soft tissue impactions or minor surgical procedures are
considered basic services and are the responsibility of the Main Dental Home Provider (MDHP).
The member may be referred to a contracted MCNA oral surgeon when it is beyond the scope
of the MDHP.

Guidelines for Endodontics
Criteria
•
•
•
•
•
•

The tooth is infected and/or abscessed
Trauma or fracture that damages the pulp
The pulp of the primary tooth is infected and the exfoliation of the deciduous tooth is not
anticipated within six months (for pulpotomy or pulpectomy only)

Criteria for Retreatment of Root Canal
•
•
•
•
•
•

Overfilled canal
Underfilled canal
Broken instrument in canal, which is not retrievable
Root canal filling material lying free in periapical tissues and acting as an irritant
Perforation of the root in the apical one-third of the canal therefore this will cause a
denial for a retreatment

MCNA_TX-P_PM[1.29]

Page 205

Provider Manual: Texas Medicaid and CHIP
XVI. Covered Services, Fee Schedules And Guidelines – CHIP Dental Services

Criteria for Apexification
•

The apex of the root is not closed and needs to be treated so closure can be achieved
(usually after trauma)

Criteria for Apicoectomy and Retrograde Filling
•

•

The apex of the tooth needs to be removed because the surrounding area is infected
and/or has an abscess; it requires a filling to be placed in the apical part of the tooth to
seal that part of the root canal
Perforation of the root in the apical one-third of the canal

Documentation Required for Authorization
•
•
•

Submit appropriate radiographs with authorization request: periapical or panorex
Emergency treatment will require a dated pre- and post-operative radiograph for claims
review
In situations where pathology is not apparent, a written narrative justifying treatment is
required

Other Considerations
•

•

Root canal therapy for permanent teeth includes diagnosis, extirpation of the pulp,
shaping and enlarging the canals, temporary fillings, filling and obliteration of root
canal(s), and progress radiographs, including a final root canal fill radiograph.
In cases where the root canal filling does not meet MCNA’s treatment standards, MCNA
can require the procedure to be redone at no additional cost. Any reimbursement
already made for an inadequate service may be recouped after MCNA reviews the
circumstances.
