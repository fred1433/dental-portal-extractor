# DDINS Data Extraction Limitations

This document lists the **27 fields** from the Master Verification Form that **cannot be auto-filled** from DDINS (Delta Dental Insurance) extraction data.

## Why These Fields Cannot Be Auto-Filled

## ðŸ“Š Procedure History (9 fields)

DDINS's `eligibility.hist.procedures[]` **only contains basic evaluation codes** (D0120, D0140, D0150). The following procedure histories are **not available**:

19. **Sealant History** (D1351)
20. **Filling History** (D2391/D2330)
21. **SRP History** (D4341)

26. **Post & Core History** (D2954)
27. **Denture History** (D5110/D5221)

### Why History Is Limited

From Gemini's analysis of Karen.json:
> "L'historique fourni (`eligibility.hist`) est trÃ¨s limitÃ© et ne contient que quelques Ã©valuations orales (D0120, D0140, D0150). Pour tous les autres codes demandÃ©s, la rÃ©ponse est qu'il n'y a **aucun historique de service trouvÃ©** dans cette extraction de donnÃ©es."
